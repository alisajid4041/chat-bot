27/09/2019, 5:38 pm - American Araiz: So basically has my physics exam on Tuesday which went good and also had a 4 hour lab so that was a hectic 8-5 day and then had to study crazy for my cal 2 exam the next day and I thought I was really well prepared and then tomorrow when I gave the exam holy fuck itna bullshit paper. Literally the paper was like a 2 hour long paper and class was only 1hr 15 min. I barley finished the paper shukar hai most the class didn’t even finish it but idk how to feel about it. So after I got done with classes on Wednesday from 8-2 I find out there’s an o Chem exam review from 3-6 so I was like let’s go for that it’ll be helpful. It was so fucking useless because the student tutor didn’t know jackshit and was a fucking idiot, however I had to stay till 6 because my friend was gonna drop me off and he wanted to stay for the session. So gave my o Chem exam today and I think it went alright. Barely running on any sleep, get done with the the ochem exam and then have my Chem eng class and the teacher is an idiot can’t explain for shit. Phir I have an hour before my 4 hour o Chem lab where I have to write two pages for my lab report before it’s due which I didn’t get time for because of studying for exams. Barely finish that on time and then the lab was so aids I got done at 5:30. Get food and wait for the shuttle. I’m waiting 30 min and it doesn’t show up and I go ask the desk and they fucking tell me shuttle timings for reduced from till 6:30 to 5:30 and they didn’t send any email informing  Anyone so I got pissed. So I had to walk back to my dorm in the scorching Texas heat and it’s a 45 min walk and I have a fucking headache from how bright the damn sun is here so yea my week has been stressful and a fucking shitshow
27/09/2019, 5:38 pm - American Araiz: Yeet

27/09/2019, 8:02 pm - American Araiz: Did you see how one piece is trending worldwide on twitter
27/09/2019, 8:02 pm - ali: is demon slayer manga worth it
27/09/2019, 8:02 pm - ali: no haven't checkes
27/09/2019, 8:02 pm - ali: why is it?
27/09/2019, 8:02 pm - American Araiz: Anime is million times better
27/09/2019, 8:03 pm - American Araiz: Because the newest chapter is singlehandedly the best manga chapter I’ve ever read
27/09/2019, 8:03 pm - American Araiz: It’s fucking crazy
27/09/2019, 8:03 pm - American Araiz: Oda the author literally flipped twenty years of story and world building on its head with the biggest plot twist ever
27/09/2019, 8:03 pm - American Araiz: And it was fucking crazy
27/09/2019, 8:04 pm - ali: damn
27/09/2019, 8:04 pm - ali: ppl are dedicated
27/09/2019, 8:04 pm - American Araiz: I obviously don’t get as invested emotionally into manga as anime it doesn’t pull me in
27/09/2019, 8:04 pm - American Araiz: But I experience every emotion in this chapter
27/09/2019, 8:04 pm - American Araiz: And one piece just shot real high up as one of my fav series
27/09/2019, 8:05 pm - American Araiz: The only two manga I would say are better than the anime are naruto and Tokyo ghoul
27/09/2019, 8:05 pm - American Araiz: Otherwise the anime is usually better for most series im a fan of
27/09/2019, 8:06 pm - American Araiz: Like aot anime is fucking amazing but the manga is fucking horrible because his art style is disgusting
27/09/2019, 8:07 pm - American Araiz: Oh because the animation in the demon slayer anime is some of the best animation I’ve ever seen in my life
27/09/2019, 8:07 pm - American Araiz: It’s so sharp and clean
27/09/2019, 8:07 pm - American Araiz: And personally watching anime is something much more entertaining and enjoyable than reading a manga
27/09/2019, 8:07 pm - ali: how many chapters of boruto are there
27/09/2019, 8:07 pm - American Araiz: 37

27/09/2019, 8:07 pm - American Araiz: Each chapter is around 50 pages
27/09/2019, 8:08 pm - ali: thats so sad for the author

27/09/2019, 8:08 pm - ali: who reads jojo manga

27/09/2019, 8:08 pm - American Araiz: That’s actually not true
27/09/2019, 8:08 pm - American Araiz: That’s my personal preference btw
27/09/2019, 8:08 pm - American Araiz: Aot and jojo are two of the highest selling manga in Japan of all time
27/09/2019, 8:09 pm - American Araiz: While one piece is the number 1 highest selling manga of the last 15 years
27/09/2019, 8:09 pm - American Araiz: It’s just that I really really prefer anime over manga
27/09/2019, 8:09 pm - American Araiz: There’s something about the anime that has to be insanely bad for me to go to reading the manga
27/09/2019, 8:09 pm - ali: 38 apparently
27/09/2019, 8:10 pm - American Araiz: That or I’m so interested in the story and the new season is taking forever to come out so I read the manga

19/11/2019, 12:00 am - American Araiz: Missed video call
19/11/2019, 5:45 am - ali: <Media omitted>
19/11/2019, 5:45 am - ali: how do u feel about this
19/11/2019, 5:46 am - American Araiz: I agree and disagree
19/11/2019, 5:46 am - American Araiz: Yea there’s quite a few things I’m disappointed that aren’t in the game
19/11/2019, 5:46 am - American Araiz: And how over half the Pokemon got cut
19/11/2019, 5:47 am - American Araiz: But there’s so much more that im excited for
19/11/2019, 5:47 am - ali: from what i can tell from gameplay it for sure doesn't look like an inferior version
19/11/2019, 5:47 am - ali: for sure but honestly i understand the outrage but ppl can't say that the company isn't trying to do something new
19/11/2019, 5:48 am - American Araiz: Yea the games look better than they ever have but people want to be toxic and hate on it just for the sake of it
19/11/2019, 5:48 am - ali: cus if they didn't cut the old pokemon out no one would use the newer ones
19/11/2019, 5:48 am - American Araiz: It’s Pokemon how can the make it completely new
19/11/2019, 5:48 am - American Araiz: They can’t change the battle system or it won’t be Pokemon anymore
19/11/2019, 5:48 am - American Araiz: They made this one more open world and non linear than any of the previous
19/11/2019, 5:48 am - ali: yea but if ur making a game every 2 years u have to change it up and not expect that oh our formula is pokemon there's no way to change it
19/11/2019, 5:48 am - American Araiz: Ones*
19/11/2019, 5:49 am - American Araiz: 3*
19/11/2019, 5:49 am - ali: not talking bout battle system but then it'll fall in the cod trope
19/11/2019, 5:49 am - American Araiz: I mean yea I agree
19/11/2019, 5:49 am - ali: of same game each year but better grao2
19/11/2019, 5:49 am - American Araiz: But I don’t know how they can change it
19/11/2019, 5:49 am - ali: graphics
19/11/2019, 5:49 am - ali: i like they added new pokemon cus kuch tou faraq aye
19/11/2019, 5:50 am - American Araiz: They do add over 80 new Pokemon every time, a brand new region, new characters, new story
19/11/2019, 5:50 am - ali: but adding new stuff doesn't mean the game will be above average tho right?
19/11/2019, 5:50 am - ali: then why are ppl complaining wtf
19/11/2019, 5:50 am - American Araiz: The biggest issue is because they cut Pokemon
19/11/2019, 5:51 am - American Araiz: But obviously there’s going to be a point where there’s so many Pokemon now it’s not feasible to add them all
19/11/2019, 5:51 am - American Araiz: There’s 890 now total
19/11/2019, 5:51 am - American Araiz: This game has around 435
19/11/2019, 5:51 am - American Araiz: And one great thing about this game is that they’ve really improved multiplayer and competitive
19/11/2019, 5:51 am - ali: feasible idk cus its a digital game lmao not taking actual space.
but yea if they kept the old pokemon ppl wouldn't try the new ones and the game won't go forward story and gameplay wise
19/11/2019, 5:52 am - ali: that's good
19/11/2019, 5:52 am - ali: but i dont get why they still make 2 diff ones like why not combine sword and shield
19/11/2019, 5:52 am - American Araiz: But for the switch apparently they had to make the models of the characters again because it’s the first switch Pokemon
19/11/2019, 5:52 am - American Araiz: Because they have different exclusive Pokemon and legendaries and it’s also an incentive to trade and engage in multiplayer
19/11/2019, 5:53 am - American Araiz: It’s been like this since the first games 23 years ago
19/11/2019, 5:53 am - ali: i understand that but lmao it sounds more like an incentive to get ppl to buy two games instead of one
19/11/2019, 5:53 am - ali: doesn't make it okay tho
19/11/2019, 5:54 am - American Araiz: Not really because if you want the Pokemon from the other games you can just trade
19/11/2019, 5:54 am - ali: thats like making fifa 20 into games and saying oh half the teams in 1 game and other half in the other
19/11/2019, 5:54 am - American Araiz: But I agree
19/11/2019, 5:54 am - ali: into 2 games*
19/11/2019, 5:54 am - American Araiz: Not half
19/11/2019, 5:54 am - American Araiz: Like one game has 10 unique Pokemon and the other has 10 unique
19/11/2019, 5:54 am - ali: hm thats nice atleast
19/11/2019, 5:54 am - American Araiz: Out of 430
19/11/2019, 5:55 am - American Araiz: So like 3/4 teams
19/11/2019, 5:55 am - ali: oh
19/11/2019, 5:55 am - American Araiz: Out of like a 100
19/11/2019, 5:55 am - ali: haan thats not a big deal i guess idk im not a hard core pokemon gamer so can't tell how srs ppl play it
19/11/2019, 5:56 am - ali: but god damn my twitter tl is all pokemon
19/11/2019, 5:56 am - American Araiz: People are way too fucking serious about it
19/11/2019, 5:56 am - American Araiz: Like it’s a fucking kids game calm down
19/11/2019, 5:57 am - American Araiz: Yes I would like to have all the Pokemon in the game. My favs aren’t even in it but I don’t mind because I want to experience a new region and it’s Pokemon and characters
19/11/2019, 5:57 am - American Araiz: If all I wanted was my fav Pokemon I would have 7 other generations to play
19/11/2019, 6:00 am - American Araiz: There’s so many cool little things I’ve seen about the game on twitter since it came out and I’m so excited
19/11/2019, 6:00 am - American Araiz: The only thing that I feel like the game really needs now is voice acting
19/11/2019, 6:02 am - American Araiz: The way the game looks now and with the amount of text dialogue it has I feel like it finally needs voice acting because other Nintendo titles like fire emblem have done it with their newest game as well
19/11/2019, 6:02 am - American Araiz: Like I’ve played Zelda breath of the Wild as well which won game of the year 2017. It was a fucking amazing game but I also feel like it really needed voice acting
19/11/2019, 7:56 am - American Araiz: Damn I type a lot
19/11/2019, 9:00 am - ali: <Media omitted>

27/11/2019, 5:03 am - American Araiz: I would never ever want that as the finale
27/11/2019, 5:03 am - ali: even part 6 with Dio's lowkey presence is interesting
27/11/2019, 5:03 am - ali: same
27/11/2019, 5:04 am - ali: but idk how jojo would end otherwise
27/11/2019, 5:04 am - ali: without a somewhat connection to all parts
27/11/2019, 5:04 am - American Araiz: At least another year
27/11/2019, 5:04 am - ali: diavolo is the worst villian ever in jojo
27/11/2019, 5:04 am - ali: angelo from part 4 is better and he's a stone
27/11/2019, 5:04 am - American Araiz: Are u stupid
27/11/2019, 5:04 am - American Araiz: Yes he’s bad
27/11/2019, 5:04 am - ali: i hate him
27/11/2019, 5:04 am - American Araiz: But he’s not even close to the worst
27/11/2019, 5:05 am - American Araiz: I despise the part 5 ending more than anyone but diavolo is not the worst villain at all
27/11/2019, 5:05 am - ali: bullshit villain with generic motives ugly ass look and doesn't even know how to use his own stand

27/11/2019, 5:07 am - ali: part 1 dio can't be worse than diavolo mann...
27/11/2019, 5:07 am - ali: part 1 dio atleast won against Johnathon
27/11/2019, 5:07 am - American Araiz: You have no idea how much I hate part 1 dio
27/11/2019, 5:07 am - ali: ugh
27/11/2019, 5:07 am - ali: agree to disagree
27/11/2019, 5:07 am - American Araiz: Part 1 dio and diavolo are both trash villains
27/11/2019, 5:07 am - American Araiz: And kars is very average
27/11/2019, 5:08 am - American Araiz: Most of the best villains in jojo aren’t even the main villains
27/11/2019, 5:08 am - American Araiz: Also are we considering doppio and diavolo is one character
27/11/2019, 5:08 am - ali: i guess?
27/11/2019, 5:08 am - ali: doppio is interesting at best
27/11/2019, 5:09 am - ali: but i dont care bout him enough to remember him after watching the part

27/11/2019, 5:09 am - ali: doppio was nice if they didn't tell us from the start that he's diavolo
27/11/2019, 5:10 am - ali: but i like him yea
27/11/2019, 5:10 am - American Araiz: I only like dio for the memes and his absurdity. If we talk about story/ motives and stuff I don’t like his one bit
27/11/2019, 5:10 am - ali: probs highlight of part 5 but forgettable for me afterwards
27/11/2019, 5:10 am - ali: understandable
27/11/2019, 5:10 am - American Araiz: I take everything into consideration when ranking a character from their motives, design, etc
27/11/2019, 5:10 am - American Araiz: Character design is a huge factor for me
27/11/2019, 5:10 am - ali: I do too lmao
27/11/2019, 5:10 am - American Araiz: And art style
27/11/2019, 5:11 am - American Araiz: Even their music themes tbh
27/11/2019, 5:11 am - American Araiz: I like giorno so much mainly because of his theme
27/11/2019, 5:11 am - ali: art style is a good plus but idc bout if the character motivations and actions are consistent
27/11/2019, 5:11 am - ali: eh
27/11/2019, 5:11 am - American Araiz: Yea I can see why
27/11/2019, 5:11 am - ali: themes are just a cherry on the top
27/11/2019, 5:11 am - American Araiz: Can we debate over call I have nothing else to do I’m bored
27/11/2019, 5:11 am - ali: i cant like a character based on just their theme

29/11/2019, 7:03 am - ali: <Media omitted>
29/11/2019, 7:04 am - American Araiz: I’ll do em for free

29/11/2019, 7:37 am - American Araiz: Idk why I asked as if I would know him I don’t even watch jojo you tubers
29/11/2019, 7:40 am - ali: also
29/11/2019, 7:40 am - ali: anime man doesn't like black clover
29/11/2019, 7:40 am - American Araiz: Yea I know I wouldn’t expect him to he doesn’t like any shounen anime
29/11/2019, 7:41 am - ali: his logic was that if a. show takes 49 eps to get good its not a good show
29/11/2019, 7:41 am - ali: what happens on ep 49
29/11/2019, 7:41 am - ali: apparently that's when the show gets good?
29/11/2019, 7:41 am - American Araiz: Yet he likes Gintama
29/11/2019, 7:41 am - ali: oh no
29/11/2019, 7:42 am - American Araiz: Nothing special as far as I remember it gets good around ep 15 imo
29/11/2019, 7:42 am - ali: wait that makes no sense cus gintama also takes time to get good
29/11/2019, 7:42 am - American Araiz: Exactly
29/11/2019, 7:42 am - ali: bruh
29/11/2019, 7:42 am - American Araiz: And the first 50 eps of gintama are way worse and slower than black clover
29/11/2019, 7:42 am - American Araiz: Oh ep 49 was a really good ep
29/11/2019, 7:43 am - ali: is jojo a Shonen?
29/11/2019, 7:43 am - ali: what is a shonen anime?
29/11/2019, 7:43 am - American Araiz: Not really I would say
29/11/2019, 7:43 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
29/11/2019, 7:44 am - American Araiz: Shounen are also primarily action based
29/11/2019, 7:44 am - American Araiz: With a large group of primary characters
29/11/2019, 7:44 am - American Araiz: I would say at least
29/11/2019, 7:44 am - American Araiz: And comedy
29/11/2019, 7:45 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
29/11/2019, 7:51 am - American Araiz: Also what video did he say this in
29/11/2019, 7:55 am - ali: https://youtu.be/1qY6BQDkYIw
29/11/2019, 7:55 am - ali: 0:45
29/11/2019, 7:57 am - American Araiz: Ok firstly I don’t even think he’s seen black clover
29/11/2019, 7:57 am - American Araiz: And anyone who says the anime was bad until ep 49 was watching it with their eyes closed
29/11/2019, 7:57 am - ali: haan lmao
29/11/2019, 7:57 am - ali: but its so weird if he didn't
29/11/2019, 7:58 am - ali: my mans has watched so much anime i get jealous
29/11/2019, 7:58 am - American Araiz: Yes the first 10-15 eps are a bit slow and the main character comes off as hella annoying but it’s gets so good it takes a complete 180
29/11/2019, 7:58 am - ali: he didnt know what bakugan battle brawlers was 😡😡😡🤡
29/11/2019, 7:58 am - American Araiz: Wat
29/11/2019, 7:58 am - American Araiz: Why do you get jealous
29/11/2019, 7:58 am - American Araiz: Really I think it’s completely normal because he doesn’t like shounen and black clover is a heavily shounen series
29/11/2019, 7:59 am - American Araiz: Most people don’t it’s hella obscure
29/11/2019, 7:59 am - ali: idk its so cool to see him talk bout so many anime and like thats the reason i watch him cus idk what he's saying half the time cus idk any animes but i just love watching someone whos so passionate and experienced in a specific genre talk bout it
29/11/2019, 7:59 am - ali: he's watched one piece naruto bleach but i guess thats mainstream?
29/11/2019, 8:00 am - ali: i thought black clover is main stream too or atleast its on its way
29/11/2019, 8:00 am - ali: also whats the vibe with seven deadly sins
29/11/2019, 8:00 am - American Araiz: Yea I get that and I agree it’s interesting seeing the opinions of someone who’s so dedicated to the industry
29/11/2019, 8:00 am - American Araiz: Those are all late 90/ early 2000 series
29/11/2019, 8:00 am - American Araiz: I don’t think he likes modern shounen
29/11/2019, 8:01 am - American Araiz: Because he probably watched them as a kid and nostalgia factor plays a huge part in how much you like a series
29/11/2019, 8:01 am - ali: i just  love his hatred for fairy tale, sword art online and tokyo ghoul anime
29/11/2019, 8:01 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
29/11/2019, 8:02 am - ali: someone actually tweeted the anime man saying that bnha is the best of the shonen
29/11/2019, 8:02 am - ali: and the comment section had a stroke
29/11/2019, 8:02 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
29/11/2019, 8:02 am - American Araiz: Except first season
29/11/2019, 8:03 am - ali: LMAOO

29/11/2019, 8:03 am - ali: why is it lowkey popular still
29/11/2019, 8:03 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
29/11/2019, 8:03 am - American Araiz: It is?
29/11/2019, 8:04 am - ali: like i saw it get recommended alot in Twitter threads
29/11/2019, 8:04 am - American Araiz: It’s popularity died a lot
29/11/2019, 8:04 am - American Araiz: Hell no don’t watch it
29/11/2019, 8:04 am - American Araiz: First season is really good and second is all right but it gets worse and worse
29/11/2019, 8:04 am - American Araiz: SAME
29/11/2019, 8:05 am - ali: do you think shonen anime are dying in terms of popularity
29/11/2019, 8:05 am - American Araiz: Not at all
29/11/2019, 8:05 am - ali: is fire force shonen?
29/11/2019, 8:05 am - American Araiz: Because it’s the most easily accessible and most common genre
29/11/2019, 8:05 am - American Araiz: Yes
29/11/2019, 8:05 am - American Araiz: So is dr stone technically I guess
29/11/2019, 8:05 am - American Araiz: But shounen is a broad category
29/11/2019, 8:07 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
29/11/2019, 8:07 am - American Araiz: I would say the most common genre of anime and manga rn is isekai
29/11/2019, 8:07 am - American Araiz: But I don’t think you would know what that means
29/11/2019, 8:10 am - ali: ive heard of the word
29/11/2019, 8:10 am - American Araiz: Would you like to know what it means
29/11/2019, 8:10 am - ali: sure
29/11/2019, 8:13 am - ali: also
29/11/2019, 8:13 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
29/11/2019, 8:13 am - ali: do mangas make jojo references??
29/11/2019, 8:13 am - American Araiz: Yes a lot of them do
29/11/2019, 8:13 am - ali: damn its that big
29/11/2019, 8:14 am - American Araiz: If an anime makes a jojo reference and that anime is based of a manga then ofc the manga would too
29/11/2019, 8:14 am - American Araiz: Yes I think u keep forgetting it started in 1987 before 95% of manga and anime existed
29/11/2019, 8:14 am - ali: i mean yea duh
29/11/2019, 8:14 am - American Araiz: It’s from the same era as dragon ball
29/11/2019, 8:14 am - ali: but jojo aged better?
29/11/2019, 8:15 am - American Araiz: Much better
29/11/2019, 8:15 am - ali: im rewatching part 4 cus i just love the setting so much
29/11/2019, 8:15 am - ali: don't hate me
29/11/2019, 8:15 am - American Araiz: I mean dbz is still hella popular but only because the same three arcs of freiza, cell and buu have been remade and milked 100’s of times
29/11/2019, 8:15 am - ali: what....that's actually lowkey interesting thooo
29/11/2019, 8:16 am - ali: re zero and no game no life
29/11/2019, 8:16 am - ali: I've heard alot
29/11/2019, 8:16 am - American Araiz: Re zero is phenomenal
29/11/2019, 8:16 am - ali: but if its repetitive then ://
29/11/2019, 8:16 am - American Araiz: The genre is but not these two
29/11/2019, 8:16 am - American Araiz: These two are the only exceptions imo
29/11/2019, 8:16 am - American Araiz: I’ve been like 10/15 isekai shows
29/11/2019, 8:16 am - American Araiz: And these were the only two I liked
29/11/2019, 8:18 am - American Araiz: I would like to explain re zero to you but that would mean spoiling the shock factor of what happens in the first couple of eps and that was one of the biggest and craziest plot twists I’ve ever seen
29/11/2019, 8:18 am - American Araiz: Seen*
29/11/2019, 8:19 am - American Araiz: You can ask saadi as well he’s seen re zero I believe
29/11/2019, 8:21 am - American Araiz: Also my hero is not the king of shounen it’s not even top 5
29/11/2019, 8:21 am - American Araiz: Dbz it’s still the king because it has a legacy and set up the foundation for all these shounen shows and I don’t even like dbz much but I still can’t deny it’s impact
29/11/2019, 8:22 am - ali: would u say naruto one piece are up there with it
29/11/2019, 8:22 am - American Araiz: Yes those are too 3 imo

One piece
29/11/2019, 8:22 am - ali: F for bleach
29/11/2019, 8:22 am - ali: man i feel so bad for Hunter x hunter fans
29/11/2019, 8:22 am - American Araiz: Bleach was it’s own worst enemy
29/11/2019, 8:22 am - ali: they keep saying it's the best show ever
29/11/2019, 8:23 am - American Araiz: Thx man it fucking sucks
29/11/2019, 8:23 am - American Araiz: Hxh is my fav shounen
29/11/2019, 8:23 am - American Araiz: And probably my second fav anime of all time
29/11/2019, 8:23 am - ali: im sure it is but my god its getting the bleach treatment
29/11/2019, 8:23 am - American Araiz: Yup and I’ve honestly given up hope
29/11/2019, 8:23 am - American Araiz: I don’t think there’s any coming back
29/11/2019, 8:24 am - ali: :(
29/11/2019, 8:24 am - ali: i love how bleach anime is technically still on a hiatus
29/11/2019, 8:25 am - ali: cus i dont think it got canceled officially
29/11/2019, 8:25 am - ali: the voice actors for bleach and hxh be like lmao see y'all never
29/11/2019, 8:25 am - American Araiz: And it makes me so sad because hxh is already acclaimed as one of the best anime of all time and if it still kept going at that rate it would’ve been perfection
29/11/2019, 8:25 am - American Araiz: Wait a minute
29/11/2019, 8:26 am - American Araiz: Bleach anime was made by the same studio as naruto
29/11/2019, 8:26 am - ali: i didnt look it up so
29/11/2019, 8:26 am - ali: ur probs right
29/11/2019, 8:26 am - American Araiz: Boruto and black clover are made by same studio as well
29/11/2019, 8:26 am - American Araiz: The most overworked anime studio is history
29/11/2019, 8:26 am - American Araiz: Tokyo ghoul as well
29/11/2019, 8:26 am - ali: waise haan on god
29/11/2019, 8:26 am - ali: how many animators do they have lmao
29/11/2019, 8:27 am - ali: can they send some to David's production
29/11/2019, 8:27 am - American Araiz: No thx
29/11/2019, 8:27 am - American Araiz: I would much rather have more black clover than part 6
29/11/2019, 8:27 am - American Araiz: Can they just cancel shitty boruto so more people can work on black clover and improve its animation
29/11/2019, 8:28 am - ali: oi
29/11/2019, 8:28 am - ali: what is persona 5
29/11/2019, 8:28 am - ali: animation
29/11/2019, 8:28 am - ali: they made an anime out of it?
29/11/2019, 8:28 am - American Araiz: Yes but it sucks
29/11/2019, 8:29 am - ali: damn
29/11/2019, 8:29 am - American Araiz: The game was perfect already idk why they wanted to make an anime
29/11/2019, 8:29 am - American Araiz: I don’t think so I’m checking and it says the anime was officially cancelled
29/11/2019, 8:31 am - American Araiz: Hxh is technically on Hiatus tho
29/11/2019, 8:31 am - American Araiz: The author said he’s on an indefinite hiatus

29/11/2019, 8:32 am - American Araiz: All I can say is that I hate the manga
29/11/2019, 8:33 am - ali: i mean yea its one of those shows that non anime viewers have heard of
29/11/2019, 8:33 am - ali: hot take
29/11/2019, 8:33 am - American Araiz: Yea and I would say that aot or fmab(fullmetal alchemist brotherhood) are the two best anime for someone who wants to get into anime
29/11/2019, 8:35 am - American Araiz: Hxh author hasn’t released a chapter in over a year
29/11/2019, 8:35 am - American Araiz: And maybe he’s released like 20/30 in the last decade
29/11/2019, 9:09 am - American Araiz: https://youtu.be/ZhWgRovPib8

09/12/2019, 11:15 am - ali: i heard he said something bout kpop
09/12/2019, 11:15 am - ali: what did he say
09/12/2019, 11:15 am - American Araiz: Wait lemme send vid
09/12/2019, 11:16 am - American Araiz: https://twitter.com/kavosyt/status/1203836698565758976?s=21
09/12/2019, 11:17 am - American Araiz: It’s just like a minute
09/12/2019, 11:18 am - ali: hmm
09/12/2019, 11:18 am - ali: I dont agree with anything h3h3 said
09/12/2019, 11:18 am - ali: but he is right bout toxic fanbase
09/12/2019, 11:19 am - ali: if he's gonna call out the kpop industry call them out bout overworking their artist and driving them to suicide
09/12/2019, 11:19 am - American Araiz: Yea same I completely agree about the toxic fan base I despise it
09/12/2019, 11:20 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
09/12/2019, 11:22 am - American Araiz: You know how much I hate the toxic kpop fan base the whole fancam trend pisses me off. But a lot of the fandom isn’t like that, most of the fandom and the artists themselves who’ve done nothing wrong get hated because a small minority of the fandom is so extremely toxic and stand out so much
09/12/2019, 11:25 am - ali: yea I totally agree:
him talking bout minors masturbating to idols was weird and if it was a "joke" then it was an awful joke.

the kpop fanbase is kpop's biggest enemy ngl cus locals are only gonna see the fans trashing anything that's not kpop rather than actually seeing the amazing talent kpop has to offer which is so shitty and unfair to artists
09/12/2019, 11:26 am - American Araiz: Exactly
09/12/2019, 11:26 am - ali: i agree but u can't deny that the good to bad fans ratio isn't that good
09/12/2019, 11:26 am - ali: like idk about minority but the toxic fans make sure to highlight themselves anytime something happens
09/12/2019, 11:27 am - ali: and its not just kpop lmao

billie eilish was allegedly canceled cus she said ew to lady gaga wearing meay dress back in 2012
09/12/2019, 11:27 am - American Araiz: I don’t think so because the issue is the good and calm fans don’t spam every single post in their line of sight. The toxic fans have literally hundreds of thousands of tweets
09/12/2019, 11:27 am - American Araiz: Idk why I agree with her lmao
09/12/2019, 11:27 am - American Araiz: That thing was gross
09/12/2019, 11:28 am - American Araiz: Someone gets cancelled on twitter every 3 days and all I see is toxic kpoppies just spamming fancams
09/12/2019, 11:29 am - ali: i agree with billie too lmao its an ugly dress
09/12/2019, 11:29 am - American Araiz: Like I don’t get the mentality behind it. Are they trying to promote their fav artist or something because they’re doing the opposite and giving them a bad name
09/12/2019, 11:29 am - ali: yea that's true aswell
09/12/2019, 11:29 am - American Araiz: Bts and billie met and took a pic at an award show so we winning
09/12/2019, 11:29 am - ali: i swear and now thank God some ppl i self aware and no one really gets canceled

09/12/2019, 11:57 am - ali: ok i guess im used to western music
09/12/2019, 11:57 am - ali: 1 album per year is enough for me
09/12/2019, 11:57 am - ali: i wouldn't want bts to overwork tbh
09/12/2019, 11:59 am - American Araiz: Tbh bts did work themselves to the bone last year and a half but they did take a one month vacation recently
09/12/2019, 11:59 am - American Araiz: Most kpop groups don’t release huge albums, mini albums are more common and they have 5-7 songs(unless it’s blackpink)
09/12/2019, 11:59 am - American Araiz: And a full album usually has 9-13 songs
09/12/2019, 11:59 am - American Araiz: But those are more rare

09/12/2019, 12:04 pm - ali: and  the fact

09/12/2019, 12:04 pm - American Araiz: Oh well then
09/12/2019, 12:05 pm - ali: like araiz genuine its like one of those shows where every ep is its own adventure
09/12/2019, 12:05 pm - ali: where 5 eps in

09/12/2019, 12:05 pm - American Araiz: You know what would be worse
09/12/2019, 12:05 pm - ali: just Mandalorian and baby yoda traveling
09/12/2019, 12:05 pm - American Araiz: They pull out a big baddie during last two eps
09/12/2019, 12:05 pm - ali: and last ep was so doo doo cus it was so anti climatic my man Mandalorian is a fucking gary stu
09/12/2019, 12:06 pm - American Araiz: Damn that’s disappointing because the trailers seemed really good
09/12/2019, 12:06 pm - ali: whats worse is they end the season with a teaser to an actual future villain
09/12/2019, 12:06 pm - ali: the show had so much potential
09/12/2019, 12:06 pm - American Araiz: Wtf so that just means this entire season was a prequel
09/12/2019, 12:06 pm - ali: and idk why no one is talking bout it or criticizing it
09/12/2019, 12:06 pm - ali: yea like build up
09/12/2019, 12:07 pm - American Araiz: Damn that sounds pretty underwhelming

15/12/2019, 2:54 pm - ali: 30k per employee??

17/12/2019, 5:18 am - American Araiz: And I am still kinda annoyed about how my Pokemon they cut but it’s not that notice because just completing a Pokédex of 400 Pokemon is still hella challenging and long imagine if it 900 I would kill myself

20/12/2019, 5:26 am - American Araiz: And In this game apparently your odds of finding one are better by breeding the Pokemon you want a shiny of with a foreign ditto(the Pokemon that can transform into anything) and hatching the eggs instead of finding them in the grass
20/12/2019, 5:27 am - American Araiz: And after finally finding someone to give me their German ditto I have hatched over 200 fucking eggs and nothing yet how to do people have the patience for this
20/12/2019, 5:27 am - American Araiz: And now my storage is full and I have to individually get rid of all 200 of them

12/02/2020, 3:55 am - ali: har koi badal raha hai
12/02/2020, 3:55 am - ali: except for u and saadi

12/02/2020, 3:56 am - American Araiz: Why do I need to change if I’m happy the way I am🤩
12/02/2020, 3:56 am - American Araiz: Tu konsa badla hai
12/02/2020, 3:56 am - ali: me and shah were discussing this
12/02/2020, 3:56 am - American Araiz: Saadi bohat badal gaya hai kya matlab
12/02/2020, 3:56 am - ali: personality wise
12/02/2020, 3:57 am - ali: I'm talking
12/02/2020, 3:57 am - American Araiz: Oh
12/02/2020, 3:57 am - ali: rona kaise achi baat hai???
12/02/2020, 3:57 am - American Araiz: I don’t think personality changes much overtime tbh
12/02/2020, 3:57 am - ali: i mean change is a wrong woes
12/02/2020, 3:57 am - ali: wors
12/02/2020, 3:57 am - ali: word
12/02/2020, 3:57 am - ali: growth is better
12/02/2020, 3:58 am - American Araiz: I mean tru I’m just messing around
12/02/2020, 3:59 am - American Araiz: I have some strong opinions on that lmao
12/02/2020, 3:59 am - ali: im listening
12/02/2020, 4:00 am - American Araiz: For me at least, if im growing it’s for myself, there were a lot of things I didn’t like about myself two year ago and I feel like I’ve grown a lot in that regard. I’m not trying to grow/change for someone else
12/02/2020, 4:01 am - American Araiz: I hate when people try to give advice to others on how improve or change some things about yourself because that person is suggesting things that would make you a better version in their eyes
12/02/2020, 4:03 am - American Araiz: And I don’t give a fuck what someone want someone wants me to look like in their eyes if it’s something I don’t want
12/02/2020, 4:03 am - American Araiz: I may have added an additional want someone there
12/02/2020, 4:04 am - American Araiz: I’m not trying to create an ideal version of myself for someone else
12/02/2020, 4:04 am - ali: that's 100% respectable and is the way like one should never change themselves at all and should love 100% of themselves but that comes with alot of self belief that all of ones traits are not toxic/unhealthy for others
12/02/2020, 4:05 am - ali: u shouldn't create an ideal version of urself but u should always give urself room for improvement cus u experience new shit everyday and ur opinions and way of life and thinking is effected by it
12/02/2020, 4:06 am - American Araiz: I completely agree but if someone is unaware of themselves being a complete inconvenience then that’s just selfish(That’s not the word I’m looking for but I can’t remember it lmao)
12/02/2020, 4:06 am - ali: thats true and i agree fuck anyone who makes other ppl change for their perspective but that shouldn't be confused with constructive criticism
12/02/2020, 4:07 am - American Araiz: Of course, every new experience is something that can improve oneself
12/02/2020, 4:07 am - ali: but i do think ones thinking (not personality) should always be growing
12/02/2020, 4:08 am - ali: no matter what
12/02/2020, 4:08 am - American Araiz: Like for example, everyone used to make fun of me for being fat and shit and it used to offend me a lot, I wanted to change that but my mental health was absolutely fucked so I couldn’t. And now that I’m trying to change that, it’s not for anyone else. Currently I could not care less what anyone thinks of my appearance, I’m doing what makes me happy
12/02/2020, 4:09 am - American Araiz: Agreed, if someone’s thinking is not growing then they’re just closed minded
12/02/2020, 4:09 am - American Araiz: Like the thing I hate a lot is when Shahraiz and other people say u should go out more and and make new friends etc
12/02/2020, 4:09 am - American Araiz: I hate that
12/02/2020, 4:10 am - ali: and that's amazing but I'm so proud of you for that u know it.

but you can't make fun of someone else shortcomings but then get offended at ur own?
12/02/2020, 4:10 am - American Araiz: That does not make me happy it does the opposite
12/02/2020, 4:10 am - ali: haan i agree if you don't want to go out thats fine thats you
if you don't wanna socialize thats fine thats you
12/02/2020, 4:10 am - ali: but you cannot complain about not having
12/02/2020, 4:10 am - ali: friends
12/02/2020, 4:11 am - American Araiz: Yea true and I know I’ve been hypocritical af a lots of times
12/02/2020, 4:12 am - American Araiz: When I look back at myself before uni I was an awfully inconsiderate person. I don’t know if I’m much better now but I think I have changed a bit in that regard
12/02/2020, 4:13 am - American Araiz: Oh yea for sure I just sometimes joke around about it. You know I prefer my own company over others I’ve told you several times. It’s just that I have made a couple of friends here but most of them have been people I can’t be myself with I don’t wanna be in that kinda friendship
12/02/2020, 4:14 am - American Araiz: I have good friends I can be myself with like u, saadi etc
12/02/2020, 4:14 am - ali: but araiz we're not there
12/02/2020, 4:15 am - American Araiz: And because of the distance gap it does become a bit shitty to not have someone in person
12/02/2020, 4:15 am - ali: we're so far away u can't depend on us
12/02/2020, 4:15 am - American Araiz: Exactly and that’s why out of the 10/15 people I have become friends with none of them are people that I have been able to connect with
12/02/2020, 4:15 am - ali: Texas is such a big place u can't be close minded that ull never meet ppl ull be comfortable with?
12/02/2020, 4:16 am - American Araiz: Sajid I don’t need to depend on people all the time to be happy, maybe it’s like once a month or something where I’m like it be nice to spend some time with a good friend
12/02/2020, 4:16 am - American Araiz: No I have met a couple like my old roommates and I try my best to hang out with them often
12/02/2020, 4:17 am - American Araiz: Tbh idk how this topic even got brought up just talking about it is making me seem self centred
12/02/2020, 4:17 am - ali: I can relate to that cus i felt the same in my first semester man.
but i found moxito in the weirdest place possible and i genuinely don't know how my last semester would have gone otherwise
12/02/2020, 4:17 am - ali: I'm just saying that doing what ur comfortable with is always gonna make you happy, but venturing out doing soemthing that ur not too familiar with my end up being a good experience?
12/02/2020, 4:18 am - American Araiz: Yea like at times I feel like it’d be nice to have a friend like that but 90% of the time I could do fine just by myself so it doesn’t bother me
12/02/2020, 4:18 am - American Araiz: Sajid I have done that lmao
12/02/2020, 4:18 am - American Araiz: And it hasn’t been a good experience a lot of times, just awkward
12/02/2020, 4:18 am - ali: that's what im talking bout!
12/02/2020, 4:18 am - ali: the growth
12/02/2020, 4:18 am - ali: ur not gonna be an Ace at going out from the start
12/02/2020, 4:18 am - ali: my man
12/02/2020, 4:19 am - ali: it's a slow pace u learn as u go
12/02/2020, 4:19 am - American Araiz: I don’t agree to this point
12/02/2020, 4:19 am - ali: and yea it might be weird and ull feel un happy but
12/02/2020, 4:19 am - ali: change is good?
12/02/2020, 4:19 am - American Araiz: I hate this saying
12/02/2020, 4:20 am - American Araiz: Change is not always good
12/02/2020, 4:20 am - American Araiz: A lot of the time it’s fucking awful
12/02/2020, 4:20 am - American Araiz: I’ve seen that first hand
12/02/2020, 4:20 am - American Araiz: In my family
12/02/2020, 4:20 am - ali: u want to live all ur life inside playing games? im not trying to go boomer on you but don't you want  experiences u can tell ur future children and shit
12/02/2020, 4:20 am - ali: what
12/02/2020, 4:20 am - ali: what how so
12/02/2020, 4:21 am - American Araiz: I don’t wanna talk about it cause that’ll be another 2 hour conversation but change always comes with risk
12/02/2020, 4:23 am - American Araiz: You say that like I’m a complete shut in
12/02/2020, 4:23 am - ali: u describe ur life like that araiz
12/02/2020, 4:23 am - ali: im not trying state anything
12/02/2020, 4:23 am - ali: haan that okay but u can't be afraid of risks tho
12/02/2020, 4:24 am - American Araiz: Then I’m probably just over exaggerating
12/02/2020, 4:24 am - American Araiz: Ehhh
12/02/2020, 4:24 am - American Araiz: It’s not that it’s just that I’m very cautious when it comes to taking risks
12/02/2020, 4:24 am - American Araiz: Wtf is this conversation tbh
12/02/2020, 4:28 am - American Araiz: I’m gonna be honest I hate having conversations like this over text as the get dragged out for double the time. All I can say is that I don’t wanna push “change” into someone else or want it pushed on me unless that person or myself is going through an insanely unhealthy phase rn and needs change. We can continue this convo some other time if u want but I have a lab report I need to work on rn lmao
12/02/2020, 4:28 am - American Araiz: Good night talk to ya later boo
12/02/2020, 4:30 am - American Araiz: And I know that for some reason you have conversations like this with every other person and it must drain u too so take a break😠
12/02/2020, 5:19 pm - ali: i can understand being cautious at the start like I said u can't go full tilt from day 1
12/02/2020, 5:20 pm - ali: i agree call is better for sure and  hope ur lab report goes well eeeeee
12/02/2020, 5:20 pm - ali: I fell asleep sorrz i couldn't text boo :(
12/02/2020, 5:21 pm - ali: hahah no not really i only have this dedicated convos with ppl i really care bout
12/02/2020, 6:00 pm - American Araiz: No probs bb
12/02/2020, 6:02 pm - American Araiz: I don’t mind having them rarely but a lot of the time conversations like these make me overthink the small things and uni life is stressful af already so I try to avoid them
12/02/2020, 10:59 pm - American Araiz: I regret having Mexican food last night
12/02/2020, 10:59 pm - American Araiz: I’ve been farting like a Gatling gun all day

16/02/2020, 11:29 pm - ali: that's an xmen ability that prof x can't ignore
16/02/2020, 11:30 pm - American Araiz: I’m still waiting for my invite

18/02/2020, 6:02 pm - American Araiz: Anxiety is not something you come up with in your head
18/02/2020, 6:03 pm - American Araiz: If you can say that about anxiety can you also say that depression is made up in your head??? Hell no
18/02/2020, 6:05 pm - ali: depression and anxiety are v different things tho
18/02/2020, 6:06 pm - American Araiz: Yes and you don’t choose to have either
18/02/2020, 6:06 pm - ali: anxiety is partly ur own mind and partly things u can't control but its for those ppl diagnosed with anxiety
18/02/2020, 6:06 pm - ali: u can't
18/02/2020, 6:06 pm - ali: its just how it is
18/02/2020, 6:07 pm - American Araiz: Yea the diagnosed cases are the more extreme ones but anxiety exists in a lot of people and not by choice
18/02/2020, 6:08 pm - American Araiz: I’ve had my social anxiety since I was young because my parents always telk me that when I was a kid I was really shy too and never made that many friends and stuff
18/02/2020, 6:09 pm - American Araiz: By kid I mean like till 7/8 years old
18/02/2020, 6:10 pm - American Araiz: Anxiety I like a combination of the environment you were raised in and how your brain developed because of it, You don’t choose to have any kind of anxiety, you’re just stuck with it
18/02/2020, 6:11 pm - American Araiz: And it is possible to slowly improve it but it’s not easy
19/02/2020, 4:17 pm - ali: defo true
but one can always improve it rather than letting it take over
19/02/2020, 6:05 pm - American Araiz: Oh yea for sure
19/02/2020, 6:06 pm - American Araiz: I can’t tell what’s worse, you replying on WhatsApp or u at naruto storm 4

26/07/2020, 6:09 am - American Araiz: I don’t think it’s a bad thing
26/07/2020, 6:10 am - American Araiz: But I feel like ur friend group has become so big that’s it’s overwhelming
26/07/2020, 6:10 am - American Araiz: I feel like u don’t have any personal time at all and haven’t had that for a while
26/07/2020, 6:11 am - American Araiz: I’m sure living with saadi is fun but that still doesn’t qualify as personal alone time
26/07/2020, 6:11 am - American Araiz: And I think the biggest issue with this is that some people start forgetting about their old friends with whom they have a distance barrier with
26/07/2020, 6:12 am - American Araiz: Speaking from experience lmao
27/07/2020, 1:03 am - ali: I guess
27/07/2020, 1:03 am - ali: it's actually not big

27/07/2020, 1:04 am - ali: I hate those ppl and i really don't want to become that

10/08/2020, 10:56 am - ali: how so
10/08/2020, 10:57 am - ali: i don't think the right relationship makes u sacrifice ur personal time for them
they become a part of ur personal time
10/08/2020, 10:57 am - American Araiz: I feel like if I’m going to be in relationship with someone, I’d be very picky like id want to be with someone who shares a lot of interests with me

10/08/2020, 11:03 am - American Araiz: Like I genuinely feel like I’m not interested in actively seeking a relationship until I’m like at least 26/27
10/08/2020, 11:03 am - American Araiz: If it naturally happens through a friendship so be it(unlikely cause I’m not a social person)

METHOD USED

All the inputs are received into array using a for loop
In order to reduce time complexity the sum and product of array is calculated by side
It will very easy to take min,max and median of the array if the array is sorted .
Array is sorted using the sort() built in function under bits/stdc++.h file.
Corresponding outputs are displayed.
CODE WITH EXPLANATION

#include <iostream>//inorder to use cin and cout
#include<bits/stdc++.h>//in order to use sort function.
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    float arr[5],sum=0,pro=1;//variables to store 5 nos, sum of all elements, product of all elements respectively
    cout << "Input 5 real numbers : " << endl;//displyas quoted message.
    for(int ctr=0;ctr<5;ctr++)//inorder to receive the inputs
        {
            cin>>arr[ctr];//stores the value in respective position.
            sum+=arr[ctr];//add to sum after receiving into array
            pro*=arr[ctr];//stores in product after receiving into array by multiplying
        }
    sort(arr,arr+5);//in order to get min max median we need to traverse the array for each value It would become easy if the array is sorted sort() sorts the array
    cout<<"The sum is : "<<sum<<endl;//Displays sum
    cout<<"The mean is : "<<sum/5<<endl;//Displays mean sum / no of elemnts
    cout<<"The median is : "<<arr[5/2]<<endl;//median is middle element after sorting hence 5/2
    cout<<"The product is : "<<pro<<endl;//Displays product of all elements
    cout<<"The smallest is : "<<arr[0]<<endl;//we sorted thus minimum element is the 1 st element of array
    cout<<"The largest is : "<<arr[4]<<endl;//we sorted thus maximum element is the last element of array


    return 0;
}
06/11/2020, 9:49 pm - American Araiz: 1b)

METHOD USED

All the inputs are received in variables a,b,c respectively
Checks all the variable if all the value is positive then call the Total function and displays the total value specified in question.
Else displays error message
CODE WITH EXPLANATION

#include <iostream>//in order to use cin and cout
using namespace std;
void Total(float a,float b,float c)//function definition for Total
{
 cout<<((a*a)/2)+(3*b*b*b)-(5*c/4);//AS per question and paranthesis for associativity
}
int main()
{
    float a,b,c;//variables to store 3 nos
    cout << "Input 3 real numbers : " << endl;//displays quoted message.
    cin>>a>>b>>c;//receiving 3 values in corresponding values
    if(a>=0&&b>=0&&c>=0)//if all values are non negative
        Total(a,b,c);//calls respective function
    else//if any oth the value is negative
    cout<<"Enter Positive nos only ";//displays quoted message.and exits

    return 0;

17/12/2020, 11:47 pm - American Araiz: i dont like talking during round
17/12/2020, 11:47 pm - American Araiz: i could try to convince everyone to do so if u back me up next time we play
17/12/2020, 11:48 pm - ali: i would back
17/12/2020, 11:48 pm - ali: but they play on phone
17/12/2020, 11:48 pm - American Araiz: plus on computer you can assign a key to toggle mute on discord so just press that while playing to mute and unmute
17/12/2020, 11:48 pm - ali: and its hard to mute on phone
17/12/2020, 11:48 pm - American Araiz: only zaira hoor and saadi

17/12/2020, 11:53 pm - ali: so i understand
17/12/2020, 11:54 pm - American Araiz: but they both still never talk during round so theyll probably just stay quiet during round
17/12/2020, 11:54 pm - American Araiz: zaira talks most i think
17/12/2020, 11:55 pm - ali: its alright i guess
17/12/2020, 11:55 pm - ali: its banter anyway

14/02/2021, 9:00 pm - ali: i don't think so
14/02/2021, 9:00 pm - ali: ill go back soon
14/02/2021, 9:00 pm - American Araiz: :(

14/02/2021, 9:01 pm - American Araiz: Doesn’t ur semester end before last week of July
14/02/2021, 9:01 pm - American Araiz: Will u not be coming in the summer?

14/02/2021, 9:01 pm - ali: cus i already came back
14/02/2021, 9:01 pm - ali: rn
14/02/2021, 9:01 pm - American Araiz: :(
14/02/2021, 9:01 pm - ali: and if i go back end March
coming back in summers is quite soon and not worth the money
14/02/2021, 9:02 pm - ali: not my decision i just do what my brother tells me regarding travel money since he covers it
14/02/2021, 9:02 pm - American Araiz: It’s up to u but I really think you should come back. For ur own mental health. I think things will be close to normal in pak by then and everyone will be there. Being stuck in Cyprus seems awful. But yea obviously it depends on money situation in the end
14/02/2021, 9:03 pm - ali: i would love to come back
14/02/2021, 9:03 pm - American Araiz: Aren’t ur semesters happening online?

14/02/2021, 9:04 pm - American Araiz: Then why go back at all
14/02/2021, 9:04 pm - American Araiz: Won’t that save a bit of money
14/02/2021, 9:04 pm - ali: only up from here
14/02/2021, 9:04 pm - American Araiz: I guess but life has just become so strange since the pandemic started, that’s all we should be blaming

08/03/2021, 12:52 am - American Araiz: Even the yakuza franchise which is huge released yakuza 7 a few months ago and tried turn based combat instead of real time action and it was the best launch of a yakuza game ever and best received and reviewed as well

08/01/2022, 1:56 am - American Araiz: Sakura worst female character in a show
08/01/2022, 1:56 am - American Araiz: Agree or disagree?
08/01/2022, 1:57 am - ali: 100%
08/01/2022, 1:57 am - ali: kisimoto a misogynist at heart he does not know how to write good female characters
08/01/2022, 1:57 am - American Araiz: Watching other anime has made me realise kishimoto could not write a good or interesting female character for the life of him
08/01/2022, 1:57 am - American Araiz: Ok thank god u agree
08/01/2022, 1:57 am - ali: Yooo we about to kiss?
08/01/2022, 1:57 am - American Araiz: This is why I’m enjoying one piece so much it has such amazing female characters
08/01/2022, 1:58 am - American Araiz: Also is it controversial to say Naruto is carried by its villains?
08/01/2022, 1:58 am - ali: tsnuade was bearable but she was soooo sexualized and for what reason lmaooo
08/01/2022, 1:58 am - ali: not really
08/01/2022, 1:58 am - American Araiz: Come here😘
08/01/2022, 1:58 am - ali: Orochimaru, Pain,  Madara itachi
08/01/2022, 1:58 am - American Araiz: Yes she actually had an interesting story
08/01/2022, 1:58 am - ali: show literally picked up properly oncr Sasuke wanted to leave
08/01/2022, 1:59 am - ali: Sasuke is my fav character cus he has some depth to him
08/01/2022, 1:59 am - ali: even Naruto has
08/01/2022, 1:59 am - American Araiz: Honestly the thing watching a second long ass show has made me realise is that the biggest weakness of Naruto
08/01/2022, 1:59 am - American Araiz: Is that it feels like there is absolutely no connection or chemistry between side characters
08/01/2022, 1:59 am - ali: yess i can see that
08/01/2022, 2:00 am - American Araiz: Like most scenes between side characters that don’t involve Naruto or sasuke feel so weak
08/01/2022, 2:00 am - ali: sakura really has no purpose in story than just love interest
08/01/2022, 2:00 am - American Araiz: Few exceptions include guy and lee ki relationship and  Kakashi with most characters
08/01/2022, 2:00 am - ali: the only ones that are really good is Jiraya with pain konan
08/01/2022, 2:00 am - American Araiz: That too
08/01/2022, 2:00 am - ali: Kakashi with obito and rin
08/01/2022, 2:00 am - ali: yess
08/01/2022, 2:01 am - American Araiz: Not even with them
08/01/2022, 2:01 am - American Araiz: Kakashi works with most characters
08/01/2022, 2:01 am - ali: Kisimoto didn't know how to end the show honestly i think he over thought it
08/01/2022, 2:01 am - American Araiz: It feels like no other characters work well together
08/01/2022, 2:01 am - ali: but Naruto  isn't a BAD show
08/01/2022, 2:01 am - ali: it's above average / good show
08/01/2022, 2:01 am - ali: that range
08/01/2022, 2:01 am - American Araiz: Why the fuck do teams like hinata kiba Shino exist
08/01/2022, 2:01 am - ali: world building thas it
08/01/2022, 2:01 am - American Araiz: Have those characters even talked to each other
08/01/2022, 2:01 am - American Araiz: Like they are semi major characters
08/01/2022, 2:02 am - American Araiz: Hinata is major right
08/01/2022, 2:02 am - ali: they get 1 episode out of 900
08/01/2022, 2:02 am - ali: ish
08/01/2022, 2:02 am - ali: like ik her back story but lmao her character arc was 3 episodes
08/01/2022, 2:02 am - American Araiz: She has no relationship with any character except naruto or neji
08/01/2022, 2:02 am - ali: and 2 of them were 400 episodes apart
08/01/2022, 2:02 am - ali: my only defense to thay is
08/01/2022, 2:02 am - ali: that is
08/01/2022, 2:02 am - ali: show is about Mauro
08/01/2022, 2:02 am - ali: naruto**
08/01/2022, 2:02 am - ali: and his story with Sasuke
08/01/2022, 2:03 am - American Araiz: I guess but theres so many good characters
08/01/2022, 2:03 am - American Araiz: But most wasted
08/01/2022, 2:03 am - ali: so i understand why kisimoto did this man was too lazy
08/01/2022, 2:03 am - American Araiz: A scene without one of those two feels way too weak
08/01/2022, 2:04 am - ali: butt
08/01/2022, 2:04 am - ali: the entire pain arc
08/01/2022, 2:04 am - ali: is one of the  best written arcs
08/01/2022, 2:04 am - ali: in any show
08/01/2022, 2:04 am - ali: Pains character
how he deals with Naruto
how Naruto deals with pains reasoning
and ending
08/01/2022, 2:05 am - ali: and that scene of the village finally embracing Naruto
08/01/2022, 2:05 am - ali: after watching the entire show does make it all soo good
08/01/2022, 2:06 am - American Araiz: I love one piece way more now because if u take any pair or trio or whatever of any of the 10 characters in the main crew in one piece the scene is amazing. Each character has great chemistry and a unique relationship with every other crew member. The show doesn’t rilie on luffy to carry it
08/01/2022, 2:06 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
08/01/2022, 2:06 am - American Araiz: Agree
08/01/2022, 2:06 am - ali: One piece much better constructed
the writer i forgot his name, knew what he was doing and had a good outline
08/01/2022, 2:06 am - American Araiz: Oda is a goat
08/01/2022, 2:06 am - American Araiz: Mf plans everything years in advance
08/01/2022, 2:07 am - ali: i think as naruto got insanely popular, kisimoto wanted to improve and expand on it but didn't do it well in hind sight
08/01/2022, 2:07 am - ali: like one of main issues is that
08/01/2022, 2:07 am - ali: Guy should have DIED
08/01/2022, 2:07 am - American Araiz: But wouldn’t it have been so much nicer if some of the side characters got some decent fights or screentime at least
08/01/2022, 2:07 am - American Araiz: Agreed
08/01/2022, 2:07 am - ali: and he should have died effecting Madara in some way
08/01/2022, 2:07 am - ali: which helps Naruto Sasuke win
08/01/2022, 2:08 am - American Araiz: Some of the side characters should’ve had some more relevance in the pain arc
08/01/2022, 2:08 am - American Araiz: Only Kakashi and hinata did
08/01/2022, 2:08 am - American Araiz: Facts
08/01/2022, 2:08 am - American Araiz: Please help
08/01/2022, 2:08 am - ali: kisimoto made madara too powerful and too spectacular and i understand the character has to live up to the hype of 11 years but mf how u gonna beat him
08/01/2022, 2:08 am - American Araiz: WHY THE FUCK DID HE INTRODUCE KAGUYA
08/01/2022, 2:09 am - American Araiz: Realie

08/01/2022, 2:09 am - ali: like bro KAKASHIS story line of his father killing himself cus he was shamed for choosing his friends over the Misson

08/01/2022, 2:09 am - American Araiz: HOW DO U SPELL IT

08/01/2022, 2:12 am - ali: cus he had already introduced
08/01/2022, 2:12 am - ali: sage of six path
08/01/2022, 2:12 am - ali: and needed to give him back story
08/01/2022, 2:12 am - American Araiz: I don’t the dude introduced 3 final villains in the arc
08/01/2022, 2:12 am - ali: and tell wtf chakra is like where dis it come from

08/01/2022, 2:13 am - American Araiz: He was widely known
08/01/2022, 2:13 am - ali: HAD THE SAME DAMN MOTIVE
08/01/2022, 2:13 am - ali: these mfs had the same motive
08/01/2022, 2:13 am - American Araiz: Everyone thought sage was the big almighty
08/01/2022, 2:13 am - ali: kisi was so lazy he was just like

08/01/2022, 2:14 am - American Araiz: If u ever feel like watching 1000eps u should watch one piece bro
08/01/2022, 2:14 am - ali: in the words of the anime man
08/01/2022, 2:14 am - ali: 'Its about the journey not the end'
08/01/2022, 2:14 am - ali: he said  this about long shows not needing a good endign
08/01/2022, 2:14 am - American Araiz: Nah bro I’m sick of bad endings in shows
08/01/2022, 2:15 am - ali: and said that one piece might not have a fulfilling one which is ok
08/01/2022, 2:15 am - American Araiz: Absolutely disagree
08/01/2022, 2:15 am - ali: me too
08/01/2022, 2:15 am - American Araiz: It won’t oda already said he knew how he wanted to end it from the start
08/01/2022, 2:15 am - ali: but i mf has watched 10000 animes so to him 1000 eps is nothing probably
08/01/2022, 2:16 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
08/01/2022, 2:16 am - American Araiz: Probably
08/01/2022, 2:17 am - American Araiz: One reaction channel I watch is doing naruto and I’ve been watching with that channel and man it has not aged well for me
08/01/2022, 2:15 am - ali: <Media omitted>

08/01/2022, 2:18 am - American Araiz: I forget to use it always
08/01/2022, 2:19 am - American Araiz: Plus for one piece, the final arc is already anticipated highly because everyone knows what it’s going to be
08/01/2022, 2:20 am - American Araiz: Every single arc that comes next has already played some plot point previously
08/01/2022, 2:20 am - ali: reallyyy
08/01/2022, 2:20 am - ali: like what are the theories
08/01/2022, 2:20 am - ali: to the treasure
08/01/2022, 2:20 am - ali: whats it gonna be
08/01/2022, 2:21 am - American Araiz: How do I explain this
08/01/2022, 2:21 am - ali: hmm
08/01/2022, 2:22 am - American Araiz: Basically there are 4 strongest pirates in the whole world who each hold a key to the final one piece treasure
08/01/2022, 2:22 am - American Araiz: Luffys goal has always been to take them down
08/01/2022, 2:22 am - ali: he doesn't want the treasure?
08/01/2022, 2:23 am - American Araiz: And in the show there is something equivalent to ancient scriptures that have predicated a war that will shake the world
08/01/2022, 2:23 am - American Araiz: Which will likely be the final arc due to how luffy has challenged the 4 emperor pirates who already have bad blood between them
08/01/2022, 2:24 am - American Araiz: He wants to be king of pirates and you have to find that treasure to become it
08/01/2022, 2:24 am - American Araiz: Because it was discovered by the previous and only king of pirates
08/01/2022, 2:24 am - ali: ohhh

08/01/2022, 2:26 am - American Araiz: Probably the biggest tbh
08/01/2022, 2:26 am - American Araiz: Might be the most popular character
08/01/2022, 2:26 am - ali: he has a bro wtf

08/01/2022, 2:28 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
08/01/2022, 2:29 am - American Araiz: There’s a hundred year void and anyone who tries to research or learn that knowledge gets silenced and the treasure that’s hidden away is supposed to contain the answers
08/01/2022, 2:30 am - ali: so that knowledge of 100 years is the treasure?
08/01/2022, 2:30 am - American Araiz: It’s one of the things I believe
08/01/2022, 2:30 am - ali: ohh okok the knowledge contains info about thr treasure
08/01/2022, 2:30 am - ali: thats sounds so cool
08/01/2022, 2:30 am - American Araiz: The knowledge is part of the treasure. There’s a lot of plot points that relate to the treasure
08/01/2022, 2:30 am - ali: so one piece is on its final arc
08/01/2022, 2:31 am - ali: ?
08/01/2022, 2:31 am - American Araiz: The most fascinating one is the lost knowledge of the world
08/01/2022, 2:31 am - American Araiz: Nope
08/01/2022, 2:31 am - American Araiz: It feels like there’s a lot left

08/01/2022, 2:32 am - American Araiz: Naruto war arc was roughly 300 episodes but that includes fillers
08/01/2022, 2:32 am - American Araiz: Longest one piece arc is like around 120 eps so far I think
08/01/2022, 2:32 am - ali: <Media omitted>
08/01/2022, 2:32 am - American Araiz: Including a few fillers because one piece has very little

08/01/2022, 2:34 am - American Araiz: There are many story points that are common between arcs
08/01/2022, 2:34 am - American Araiz: But main plot is usually different
08/01/2022, 2:34 am - American Araiz: I meant boruto manga
08/01/2022, 2:35 am - ali: oh axhaa

08/01/2022, 2:37 am - American Araiz: But honestly one piece feels long until you get hooked, then it’s not long enough
08/01/2022, 2:37 am - ali: LMAOOO WHAAAT

12/02/2022, 12:38 am - American Araiz: Fair enough. You’re right about the fact that before we played I should’ve reached out and talked about if you’re doing okay but I genuinely did not know how to approach that conversation. But when it was all happening I’m pretty sure none of us were aware of the specifics of what exactly was happening like moving in with him and then the divorce etc. I did not even know most of the details because I can’t read your mind and texting you to have you explain your entire circumstances would just be making you relive it. So idk what I should’ve done but I admit I shouldn’t have stayed silent 

But about what happened when we played gartic phone is a different story. Because you had already gotten the best possible outcome with the divorce I thought a joke or two would be harmless. After the five minutes of jokes when you said you were uncomfortable we stopped immediately, apologised and never brought it up again. So don’t say it like we never stoped joking about it. And idk what your situation is with everyone else, but I have a massive problem with this. On the group you used to be so mean and rude to me and whenever someone made a joke or made fun of me you would dogpile on it and take it too far. Did you ever stop when i felt uncomfortable and hurt. No. And whenever I said something back you would always get offended and mad. I would always have to walk around eggshells with you. You’re as much of a hypocrite as the people you make fun of. 

Everyone has their hardships going on in life if you expect the role of 5 of your friends is just to pity your circumstances and try to read your mind and be your therapist, then I’m sorry I’m not trying to be that kind of friend in the first place. I’m glad you found this narrative to spin because this is just a toxic friendship I can get rid off. You’ve always been an asshole to me. Always been an absolute nightmare to try to talk to with the amount of ghosting you do. And sorry for the harsh truth but you’re a bitter and self centred person who thinks the world revolves around you. I hope you enjoy whatever sense of companionship you’re trying to find with Shahraiz. The sexual tension between you two has always been unbearable. And good riddance to this friendship :)

03/03/2022, 8:03 pm - ali: easyy thankuu
03/03/2022, 8:10 pm - American Araiz: ANSWER :

As Doug McMillon, Walmart's leader and CEO, the means that I would take to improve the organization's flexibly chain are-

1. Supply chain intelligence :

Supply chain intelligence can beimproved with more utilization of trend setting innovations. In the present computerized time, innovation has become the lifestyle. Innovation causes us to offer improved types of assistance and better business capacities.

2. Continuous Improvement :

Though we center around maintainability and sustainable power source in our gracefully chain capacities, it is generally likely to have blunders. These blunders can be corrected by nonstop improvement (CI) activities.

3. Omni -channel initiatives :

Omni-channel is a way to deal with give incorporated client experience through coordinating over the channels to improve client experience. The explanation I choose omni-channel instead of multi-channel is that multi-channel is exceptionally conventional with only a physical store and a site. Be that as it may, omni-channel activities incorporate all the channel components called contact focuses.

Hence, it is relevant to state that these predominant changes in flexibly chain would help in the drawn out supportability for Walmart in the business.

Walmart challenges are regarding its employees such as:

Lowering salaries
Unsatisfactory working states
Incompetent haleness supervision.
The comprehensive extent of restraint
Duplication
Implications for its supply chain are as follows:

Walmart should practice necessary businessperson communities.

They must classify the commodity contribution.

They must invest in superior inventory technology.

They must manage commodity levels of single-pack into various pack sizes.

They should link to profoundly automated dealing markets.

04/04/2022, 12:02 am - American Araiz: We will start with the design of the Clocked Synchronous Circuit using Mealy Machine First. (Part i of the question)

i) Design of Mealy State Machine

As you know, in the mealy state machine, the present output depends on the present state and present input simultaneously not like Moore machine, where the output depends only on the present state. So based on the requirement, we will decide what are the states required for mealy machine. We will list the states as follows.

State A - represents initial state.(no valid sequence received)
State B - represents detection of "0"
State C - represents detection of "01"
State D - represents detection of "011"
As we are designing a state machine where overlapped sequences also to be detected, we are using the state B for the next state to state D if another "0" is detected (i.e., total "0110" detected). The state diagram based on this assumption is shown below.
04/04/2022, 12:02 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
04/04/2022, 12:03 am - American Araiz: As we are having four states, we encode these states as follows.

A - 00
B - 01
C - 10
D - 11
The state Table using the above state encoding and state diagram is shown below.
04/04/2022, 12:03 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
04/04/2022, 12:03 am - American Araiz: Here, X represents the input and Z represents the Output. As it is not mentioned to choose any particular flipflop to design the circuit in the question, we will choose D flipflop for the design.

So we need to know the Excitation table of D flipflop to proceed with the design. The excitation table is given below.
04/04/2022, 12:03 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
04/04/2022, 12:04 am - American Araiz: ill send rest in a bit
04/04/2022, 12:10 am - ali: thank u sm king
04/04/2022, 12:16 am - American Araiz: Using both the Excitation table of the flipflop and the Next state table shown above, we will create the Transition Table/Excitation Table of the machine as follows.
04/04/2022, 12:16 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
04/04/2022, 12:16 am - American Araiz: Based on the Excitation Table, We need to find out the optimal logic expression for the D inputs as well as the output Z. So we will use K Map technic for the same as given below.

16/09/2022, 2:20 pm - American Araiz: I haven’t really heard of any of these cases
16/09/2022, 2:20 pm - American Araiz: This probably happens with smaller series that don’t get too popular
16/09/2022, 2:20 pm - ali: did bleach end i can't remember
16/09/2022, 2:21 pm - American Araiz: Because no publisher picks that series up
16/09/2022, 2:21 pm - American Araiz: Yea
16/09/2022, 2:21 pm - American Araiz: Manga was always consistent
16/09/2022, 2:21 pm - American Araiz: Anime was not

16/09/2022, 2:22 pm - American Araiz: Nah there are some small breaks he takes. I think a few years ago he decided he would always take 1 week break after every 3 chapters
16/09/2022, 2:22 pm - American Araiz: He had a one month break a few months ago too
16/09/2022, 2:23 pm - American Araiz: But he definitely overworks himself a lot
16/09/2022, 2:23 pm - ali: yeaa jesus
16/09/2022, 2:23 pm - American Araiz: He said in an interview that for the last 25 years. He only gets 3-5 hours of sleep every night
16/09/2022, 2:24 pm - American Araiz: Apparently some days he just stays in studio and doesn’t go back home to family
16/09/2022, 2:24 pm - American Araiz: He can take as many breaks as he wants man I need him to stay healthy
16/09/2022, 2:24 pm - ali: damn bro

16/09/2022, 2:25 pm - American Araiz: When he entered final saga about a month ago
16/09/2022, 2:25 pm - American Araiz: He said he is expecting about 3 years
16/09/2022, 2:25 pm - American Araiz: But there’s no way. I think it will take 4/5. He always takes more time for arcs than he expected
16/09/2022, 2:26 pm - ali: if next 5 years winds of winter doesn't come out im gonna die
16/09/2022, 2:26 pm - ali: if op ends before the 6th book

16/09/2022, 2:28 pm - American Araiz: He’s taking so long bro😭
16/09/2022, 2:28 pm - American Araiz: George gives off the vibe that he takes 30 min a day and only writes one line and is like hmm that’s enough for today
16/09/2022, 2:27 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
16/09/2022, 2:29 pm - American Araiz: Why is he focusing so much on side projects
16/09/2022, 2:29 pm - American Araiz: First Elden ring
16/09/2022, 2:29 pm - American Araiz: Now house of dragon
16/09/2022, 2:29 pm - ali: yes he's talked alo5 about he feels very insecure alot of the  time that was he even a good writer cus it takes so long

16/09/2022, 2:32 pm - ali: yea, he got covid recently and mfs  shat themselves
16/09/2022, 2:32 pm - American Araiz: Definitely slowest writer I’ve seen. Hopefully the upcoming books are worth the time they took lol

27/09/2022, 8:48 pm - ali: but story hmm
27/09/2022, 8:48 pm - American Araiz: Yea the animation of edgerunners is nowhere near arcane. Arcane is unmatched. It’s so I’ll pretty good but edgerunners story and characters are miles ahead of arcane
27/09/2022, 8:48 pm - American Araiz: And the pacing is perfection
27/09/2022, 8:49 pm - American Araiz: Still pretty good*
27/09/2022, 8:50 pm - American Araiz: I genuinely did not think that 10 20 min eps would make me this attached and emotional over the characters

06/10/2022, 2:06 pm - ali: yea
06/10/2022, 2:07 pm - American Araiz: Direwolves barely played a part in the show
06/10/2022, 2:07 pm - ali: show runners cut out stuff like this cus they worried it'll be too complicated
06/10/2022, 2:07 pm - American Araiz: L
06/10/2022, 2:07 pm - ali: they didn't revive catelyn cus they didn't want death to lose meaning lmao

09/10/2022, 6:55 pm - American Araiz: Sajid I have a question
09/10/2022, 6:55 pm - American Araiz: Would u rather have a bad ending or no ending
09/10/2022, 6:55 pm - ali: no ending duh
09/10/2022, 6:55 pm - American Araiz: Damn I would rather have a bad ending
09/10/2022, 6:55 pm - ali: never why ruin it
09/10/2022, 6:56 pm - ali: no ending still better cus u can read and interpret ur own ending
09/10/2022, 6:56 pm - ali: like most fans have
09/10/2022, 6:56 pm - American Araiz: The unsatisfaction of something never ending is the worst for me
09/10/2022, 6:56 pm - ali: like i kinda know roughly how George might end it
09/10/2022, 6:56 pm - American Araiz: Nah I don’t work like this. I need what the author had in mind
09/10/2022, 6:57 pm - American Araiz: Never knowing how berserk will end always makes me hella depressed
09/10/2022, 6:57 pm - ali: but for example the show ending is much  worse and literally destroyed the franchise
09/10/2022, 6:57 pm - ali: until hotd came
09/10/2022, 6:57 pm - American Araiz: Even tho it’s not the authors fault. Poor guy died
09/10/2022, 6:57 pm - ali: yeaa
09/10/2022, 6:57 pm - American Araiz: I mean sure I guess but I would rather have that ending
09/10/2022, 6:57 pm - American Araiz: To have some sort of conclusion
09/10/2022, 6:58 pm - ali: a bad ending can literally ruin the whole series
09/10/2022, 6:58 pm - ali: for me
09/10/2022, 6:58 pm - American Araiz: Yea not for me
09/10/2022, 6:58 pm - American Araiz: Depends on the person I guess
09/10/2022, 7:00 pm - ali: that's insane to me
09/10/2022, 7:00 pm - ali: i guess anime is different to
09/10/2022, 7:00 pm - ali: live action
09/10/2022, 7:00 pm - American Araiz: This isn’t even about anime
09/10/2022, 7:01 pm - American Araiz: I feel the same for live action
09/10/2022, 7:01 pm - ali: joey said the same thing
09/10/2022, 7:01 pm - ali: when talkign bout for example
09/10/2022, 7:01 pm - ali: one piece ending
09/10/2022, 7:01 pm - American Araiz: What did he say
09/10/2022, 7:01 pm - ali: he said he doesn't care for a good ending cus its more about the journey
09/10/2022, 7:02 pm - ali: so a bad ending won't effect him
09/10/2022, 7:02 pm - American Araiz: I would like a good ending but yes
09/10/2022, 7:02 pm - American Araiz: It will defo make me quite a bit disappointed
09/10/2022, 7:02 pm - American Araiz: But one piece journey is so perfect that literally nothing that happens in the future will change my view of it negatively
09/10/2022, 7:02 pm - ali: haan whens something so long runnign
09/10/2022, 7:02 pm - ali: it makes sense I get that
09/10/2022, 7:03 pm - American Araiz: It could have the worst ending imaginable and all the stuff till now will still be perfection
09/10/2022, 7:03 pm - American Araiz: True this is more applicable to longer shows
09/10/2022, 7:03 pm - American Araiz: Anything in live action over 30 eps I consider long
09/10/2022, 7:03 pm - American Araiz: And 50 eps in anime
09/10/2022, 7:04 pm - American Araiz: If it’s less than these lengths then ending could ruin whole show for me
09/10/2022, 7:04 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
09/10/2022, 7:06 pm - American Araiz: This might be a hot take. But asoiaf and got fans are still a bit too hung up over the ending
09/10/2022, 7:06 pm - American Araiz: I’m surprised that ppl aren’t over it yet
09/10/2022, 7:06 pm - ali: araiz
09/10/2022, 7:06 pm - ali: pls don't
09/10/2022, 7:07 pm - ali: got had the potential of being goat show
09/10/2022, 7:07 pm - American Araiz: Then that’s exactly why I don’t understand why u don’t want a book ending after that awful show ending
09/10/2022, 7:07 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
09/10/2022, 7:08 pm - ali: they never should
09/10/2022, 7:08 pm - ali: characters assassination
09/10/2022, 7:09 pm - American Araiz: Ok yea then if ppl feel this way
09/10/2022, 7:09 pm - American Araiz: How can they also feel this way
09/10/2022, 7:09 pm - ali: araiz if imagine at the end luffys like i never really wanted that dream
09/10/2022, 7:09 pm - American Araiz: These two takes completely contradict each other
09/10/2022, 7:09 pm - American Araiz: Yes I would kill myself ngl
09/10/2022, 7:10 pm - American Araiz: Ur completely right about show ruining the characters
09/10/2022, 7:09 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
09/10/2022, 7:11 pm - American Araiz: Man this sounds like copium. How are u happy with making it up in ur mind then having the author finish his story he’s been making for 2 decades
09/10/2022, 7:12 pm - American Araiz: Pretty similar for one piece. U can vaguely see the direction all the characters but of oda decided to not conclude and I just had to imagine for myself I would be furious. I would billion perfect take a bad ending over this
09/10/2022, 7:12 pm - ali: he's alway been a slow writer, that's just how he is, fans harassing him and bullying him is only gonna fuck up his mental health or worse genuinely make him ill
09/10/2022, 7:13 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
09/10/2022, 7:14 pm - American Araiz: Eh idk man. Yea the harassment and bullying is fucked up and should never happen but fans should be allowed to somewhat pester him
09/10/2022, 7:15 pm - American Araiz: Idk I feel like some book fans are babying him too much
09/10/2022, 7:15 pm - ali: absolutely not lmaoo
09/10/2022, 7:15 pm - American Araiz: Yea sure it’s his story but his career and success is all because of the fans. The fans deserve a conclusion
09/10/2022, 7:15 pm - ali: search grrm on Twitter
09/10/2022, 7:15 pm - ali: most comments will be like
09/10/2022, 7:15 pm - ali: lazy bastard finsih it
09/10/2022, 7:15 pm - ali: any interview he does mfs complain why isn't he writing
09/10/2022, 7:16 pm - American Araiz: But it’s a valid complain😭
09/10/2022, 7:16 pm - American Araiz: Ofc people being aggressive and rude and harassing is never ok
09/10/2022, 7:16 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
09/10/2022, 7:17 pm - ali: yes duh but at this point us complaining won't do anything but stress him out
09/10/2022, 7:18 pm - ali: Neil gaiman another author said that grrm isn't our bitch that we can annoy and force him to write at our pace
09/10/2022, 7:19 pm - American Araiz: No I genuinely cannot understand how u feel this way Lmao
09/10/2022, 7:19 pm - American Araiz: I mean sure. There’s a line fans shouldn’t cross
09/10/2022, 7:19 pm - ali: im the only person genuinely i feel who doesn't pester him lmao
09/10/2022, 7:19 pm - ali: huge asoiaf YouTubers and fans
09/10/2022, 7:19 pm - ali: annoy him all the time
09/10/2022, 7:19 pm - American Araiz: But it feels to me that grmm isn’t doing enough to to give the fans what the deserve
09/10/2022, 7:19 pm - American Araiz: And if ur take is that fans don’t deserve anything then that is delusional
09/10/2022, 7:20 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
09/10/2022, 7:22 pm - American Araiz: Idk his entire background but I’m sure he started writing to become a successful and famous writer. Mf got ended up getting on of the most successful franchises in history and it’s thanks to the fans. They deserve a proper ending, even if he has to put in some more hours. The slow writing is justifiable to a point. Not when it takes 11 damn years
09/10/2022, 7:22 pm - ali: books aren't the same as managa where they can write a chapter and then release it
09/10/2022, 7:23 pm - ali: yes obviously 11 years is a lot but again what will complaining do lmao he'll release it whenever he feels its good enough
09/10/2022, 7:25 pm - American Araiz: Ok if the quicker will slightly affect his work and make it slightly worse. Would u take a slightly rushed ending even if it’s just slightly worse than his quality. Or that he takes his time and hopefully not ends up passing away (man I old af).and u end up with nothing
09/10/2022, 7:26 pm - American Araiz: Bro u are making it sound like it is Jesus Christ writing the Bible 😭
09/10/2022, 7:26 pm - ali: hmmm
09/10/2022, 7:27 pm - ali: id rather take he takes his time
09/10/2022, 7:27 pm - American Araiz: Ayo where did the vn go
09/10/2022, 7:27 pm - American Araiz: Even if he ends up passing way and u get nothing at all?
09/10/2022, 7:27 pm - ali: knowing that the fans had an effect on the ending
09/10/2022, 7:27 pm - ali: woudl be terrible
09/10/2022, 7:27 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
09/10/2022, 7:28 pm - American Araiz: Ofc not I’m saying harassment is never acceptable
09/10/2022, 7:29 pm - ali: i think i appreciate george alot cus his mind created one of my fav book series and look how popular got was and how good hotd is, all cus of his writing and characters
09/10/2022, 7:29 pm - American Araiz: But I find it a bit crazy from George that he’s not trying to at least change his style a bit a maybe pick up the pace
09/10/2022, 7:29 pm - ali: a part of me believes he doesn't have a concrete
09/10/2022, 7:29 pm - ali: ensign
09/10/2022, 7:29 pm - American Araiz: It’s two books left. Do u really think that between book six and seven will be only a year or smth
09/10/2022, 7:29 pm - ali: ending like
09/10/2022, 7:29 pm - American Araiz: Man doesn’t have 20 years left
09/10/2022, 7:29 pm - ali: book 7 i think will be a bit shorter
09/10/2022, 7:30 pm - American Araiz: Ok this is even worse then
09/10/2022, 7:30 pm - American Araiz: If this is the reasoning u can’t come up with an ending in 11 damn years. Then that’s ur fault as a writer
09/10/2022, 7:30 pm - American Araiz: Idc how complex the world he has made is
09/10/2022, 7:31 pm - American Araiz: Hope we’ll find out
09/10/2022, 7:30 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
09/10/2022, 7:31 pm - American Araiz: So do u think nothing he will do will be even slightly similar to show approach
09/10/2022, 7:32 pm - American Araiz: He can take some of the show things possibly and build on them

09/10/2022, 7:33 pm - ali: not that important

12/10/2022, 3:39 pm - ali: idk i still enjoy them
12/10/2022, 3:39 pm - American Araiz: None of the recent movies I’ve really enjoyed
12/10/2022, 3:39 pm - American Araiz: But loved the shows
12/10/2022, 3:39 pm - ali: like phase 4 is exactly like phase 2
12/10/2022, 3:39 pm - ali: and phase 1
12/10/2022, 3:40 pm - American Araiz: Marvel is going heavy into quantity over quality
12/10/2022, 3:40 pm - American Araiz: Bro I saw a post. I think 2023 or 2024 has as many movies in a year as all of phase 1
12/10/2022, 3:41 pm - ali: i agree on this
12/10/2022, 3:41 pm - American Araiz: Like the movies recently I have had major issues with pacing in all of them
12/10/2022, 3:41 pm - American Araiz: While shows have been great on pacing
12/10/2022, 3:41 pm - ali: really
12/10/2022, 3:41 pm - ali: i actually liked the pacing it's the humor they're not involving
12/10/2022, 3:41 pm - American Araiz: Yea. Strange 2 and Thor 4 I found both very rushed
12/10/2022, 3:42 pm - American Araiz: Don’t get me started again on the Thor 4 humor
12/10/2022, 3:42 pm - American Araiz: I went back and watched some clips
12/10/2022, 3:42 pm - ali: hahaha
12/10/2022, 3:42 pm - American Araiz: And it made me dislike the movie more
12/10/2022, 3:42 pm - ali: i liked it
12/10/2022, 3:42 pm - ali: some were
12/10/2022, 3:42 pm - ali: cringey but
12/10/2022, 3:42 pm - American Araiz: Thor 3 was so perfect man
12/10/2022, 3:42 pm - ali: internet made it seem like the worst movie ever
12/10/2022, 3:42 pm - American Araiz: I think the hate was justified tbh
12/10/2022, 3:42 pm - American Araiz: I’m not a picky person with marvel
12/10/2022, 3:42 pm - ali: so good
12/10/2022, 3:43 pm - American Araiz: But that movie felt off to me
12/10/2022, 3:43 pm - ali: taika rehashed everything
12/10/2022, 3:43 pm - ali: every movie that's not avengers is gonna feel like filler
12/10/2022, 3:43 pm - American Araiz: Strange 2 was still good but some really bad dialogue
12/10/2022, 3:43 pm - ali: yess

12/10/2022, 3:43 pm - ali: shang chis finale idk what they were doing
12/10/2022, 3:43 pm - American Araiz: I think the new titles are better than the sequels
12/10/2022, 3:43 pm - American Araiz: True
12/10/2022, 3:44 pm - ali: yess uff

12/10/2022, 3:44 pm - American Araiz: Yea I don’t like those either
12/10/2022, 3:44 pm - American Araiz: But I also put Thor 4 in that category
12/10/2022, 3:45 pm - American Araiz: I think marvel should focus more on their new characters
12/10/2022, 3:45 pm - American Araiz: <Media omitted>

14/10/2022, 1:27 am - American Araiz: Yea as It should. Those are best endings imo. Luffys death is something that’s inevitable I think
14/10/2022, 1:27 am - ali: <Media omitted>
14/10/2022, 1:28 am - American Araiz: Bro😭

14/10/2022, 1:29 am - ali: <Media omitted>
14/10/2022, 1:30 am - ali: he views show and book as two different canon
14/10/2022, 1:30 am - ali: like I respect he doesn't  publicly slate dnd cus its v easy
14/10/2022, 1:31 am - ali: he still has respect foe them cus the show was still one of the more faithful book adaptations fantasy genre has had
14/10/2022, 1:31 am - ali: and part he feels bad he didn't have books ready but also dnd skipped a whole book and a half sk

14/10/2022, 1:34 am - ali: yeaa
14/10/2022, 1:37 am - American Araiz: I really hope oda don’t rush things because man said the final saga should be 3-5 years and I have no idea how he’s gonna conclude everything in that long when just the last arc itself took 4 years

17/10/2022, 8:37 pm - American Araiz: And would maybe make the live action too dragged out

18/10/2022, 5:58 pm - ali: practice match so funny
18/10/2022, 5:58 pm - ali: like literally a week ago khel rahe thay
18/10/2022, 5:58 pm - ali: why they need a warmup
18/10/2022, 5:59 pm - American Araiz: It’s so goofy u can sub off players in it
18/10/2022, 5:59 pm - ali: CRYING
18/10/2022, 5:59 pm - American Araiz: Mfs bowl 2 overs and then dip
18/10/2022, 7:16 pm - ali: also
18/10/2022, 7:16 pm - ali: another scene
18/10/2022, 7:16 pm - ali: rhayns saying to allicent
18/10/2022, 7:16 pm - ali: have u ever imagined urself on iron throne
18/10/2022, 7:16 pm - ali: i didnt get
18/10/2022, 7:16 pm - ali: what symbolism
18/10/2022, 7:16 pm - ali: or literally what
18/10/2022, 7:17 pm - ali: how would allicent even remotely get there😭
18/10/2022, 7:17 pm - American Araiz: I think that whole scene was rhaenys bluntly telling her that all she does is serve men to put them on the throne and has to ambition or desire of her own
18/10/2022, 7:17 pm - American Araiz: Which is completely valid
18/10/2022, 7:18 pm - American Araiz: Idk how it would work but as queen wouldn’t she have the most authority after the kings death
18/10/2022, 7:18 pm - ali: nope
18/10/2022, 7:18 pm - ali: hmm
18/10/2022, 7:18 pm - American Araiz: Has no ambition*
18/10/2022, 7:18 pm - ali: after kings death , the hand makes procedures
18/10/2022, 7:18 pm - ali: and instantly install the next king
18/10/2022, 7:18 pm - American Araiz: She is basically stuck in a loop of the patriarchal system
18/10/2022, 7:18 pm - ali: hm
18/10/2022, 7:19 pm - American Araiz: That was probably my favorite scene in the ep tbh
18/10/2022, 7:19 pm - ali: that would work even more if she didnt have this misunderstanding trope
18/10/2022, 7:19 pm - American Araiz: I wanna go back and see the exact lines rhaenys said but they gave me chills for the first time in this series
18/10/2022, 7:20 pm - American Araiz: Maybe but I think that still doesn’t change the context of that conversation between then
18/10/2022, 7:20 pm - American Araiz: Them*
18/10/2022, 7:21 pm - ali: i get what the show is trying to do, it just for me makes 0 sense with previous episodes and early allicent , one minute shes like oo targs have queer customes and then wed brother to sis
18/10/2022, 7:22 pm - American Araiz: I mean yea she is also completely ignoring that her son is a rapist and biggest partaker in adultery ever
18/10/2022, 7:22 pm - ali: one min shes like aegon u should be king cus rhaeynar is a liar and will kill us all if ppl oppose her and 2nd shes like what we gonna kill rhaeynar? like it potrays allicent as sucha  stupid character
18/10/2022, 7:22 pm - ali: like stupid as in shes clueless of how rhaeynar would react
18/10/2022, 7:22 pm - ali: or rhaeyns or corlys
18/10/2022, 7:22 pm - American Araiz: I think there are a lot of alicent traits that were brought up but not addressed later on
18/10/2022, 7:23 pm - American Araiz: I mean for us it’s one minute. For show timeline it’s like 20+ years😭
18/10/2022, 7:23 pm - ali: but thats now how shows work?
18/10/2022, 7:24 pm - American Araiz: But after the dinner with viserys. It seemed like alicent and Rhaenyra had repaired their relationship a bit
18/10/2022, 7:24 pm - American Araiz: Rhaenyra even said she would come back on dragon after dropping off kids
18/10/2022, 7:25 pm - American Araiz: Yea because she still seems kinda oblivious to how much manipulation and things go on in the shadows. She is not as clever as cersei
18/10/2022, 7:25 pm - American Araiz: Yet at least
18/10/2022, 7:25 pm - ali: 20 years in kings landing is hilarous not to be
18/10/2022, 7:25 pm - ali: shes working with larys?
18/10/2022, 7:25 pm - ali: shes clearly doin underground stuff
18/10/2022, 7:26 pm - American Araiz: But remember how she never explicitly gave him orders and was surprised that he killed his brother and dad
18/10/2022, 7:26 pm - American Araiz: Larys just picks up on her hints seems like and takes action
18/10/2022, 7:27 pm - ali: yea but her motivation was still to get otto back to get him to back allicents claim that rhaeynars chidlrensa r bastarads
18/10/2022, 7:27 pm - ali: bastards
18/10/2022, 7:27 pm - American Araiz: Doesn’t this make sense of alicent being hesitant rn
18/10/2022, 7:27 pm - ali: to further prove that aegon should be king and discredit?
18/10/2022, 7:28 pm - ali: all this does doesnt make any sense casue now
18/10/2022, 7:28 pm - American Araiz: Hmm I guess
18/10/2022, 7:28 pm - ali: show is potraying that oo allicent believes aegon should be king
18/10/2022, 7:28 pm - ali: cus viserys
18/10/2022, 7:28 pm - ali: whispered it to her
18/10/2022, 7:28 pm - ali: last minute
18/10/2022, 7:28 pm - American Araiz: The misunderstanding was kinda eh
18/10/2022, 7:28 pm - American Araiz: I agree
18/10/2022, 7:28 pm - ali: and she genuinly believes it
18/10/2022, 7:28 pm - American Araiz: But I think the attempt at fixing the bridge between alicent and Rhaenyra was a good thing the show included
18/10/2022, 7:29 pm - ali: allicent is not a stupid or easily manipulated person she knows what shes doing like the hightowers
18/10/2022, 7:29 pm - ali: i think that was show giving viserys one last happy moment
18/10/2022, 7:29 pm - ali: moreso
18/10/2022, 7:29 pm - American Araiz: Yea she is very fixated on these last words
18/10/2022, 7:29 pm - ali: ill be really upset if next ep
18/10/2022, 7:29 pm - ali: rhaeynar isnt balls to the wall
18/10/2022, 7:29 pm - ali: angry
18/10/2022, 7:30 pm - ali: i do not agree with changing a characters actions to make them more likable
18/10/2022, 7:30 pm - ali: and less villianous
18/10/2022, 7:30 pm - American Araiz: Idk bro. If that’s the case that’s quite fanservicey
18/10/2022, 7:30 pm - ali: this story has 2 villains the greens and the red but the show also is like no actually its only the patriachy
18/10/2022, 7:30 pm - ali: yea i agree
18/10/2022, 7:31 pm - American Araiz: Alicent is definitely not more likeable to me at all. But it shows that she at least still has some humanity and respect for her late husband at least
18/10/2022, 7:31 pm - American Araiz: To not have his first child murdered
18/10/2022, 7:31 pm - ali: yea but wanted the eye of an 8 year old boy
18/10/2022, 7:31 pm - American Araiz: I mean what mother wouldn’t react like that in the heat of the moment
18/10/2022, 7:31 pm - ali: accused his said daughter of infedility
18/10/2022, 7:31 pm - ali: and plot behind larys
18/10/2022, 7:31 pm - American Araiz: If ur child got his eye taken out
18/10/2022, 7:32 pm - American Araiz: I think alicents reaction in that scene was appropriate
18/10/2022, 7:32 pm - ali: like comeone are u srs that allicent now all of a sudden cares about rhaeynar
18/10/2022, 7:32 pm - American Araiz: I personally think that there has never been strong hate from alicent towards Rhaenyra but it has always been jealousy
18/10/2022, 7:33 pm - ali: haan i do not deny, i interpreted the scene as that allicent was more pushed as to how eveyone is gaslighting her against rhayenar again, her line that everything under rhaeynars foot gets trampled implies that
18/10/2022, 7:34 pm - ali: they could have easily played into that fear of what rhaeynar will do to allicents family if the public dont agree with her cus shes a woman
18/10/2022, 7:34 pm - ali: and that pushes to push aegon on thrown in a sense to do whats right and save everyone
18/10/2022, 7:34 pm - American Araiz: But Rhaenyra has never shown any intent of harming alicents family
18/10/2022, 7:34 pm - American Araiz: Otto and alicent believe that they would be in danger for some reason
18/10/2022, 7:34 pm - ali: that entire scene of aemonds eye
18/10/2022, 7:34 pm - American Araiz: Otto moreso
18/10/2022, 7:35 pm - ali: she got no reprucussions
18/10/2022, 7:35 pm - ali: pretty good base as to what future might hold
18/10/2022, 7:35 pm - ali: and if rhaeynar can lie, cheat and take her kids eye
18/10/2022, 7:35 pm - ali: whats stopping from future?
18/10/2022, 7:35 pm - American Araiz: Exactly so it’s jealousy from alicent
18/10/2022, 7:35 pm - ali: yes!!! which should be more pervalent
18/10/2022, 7:35 pm - American Araiz: She wishes she had that freedom
18/10/2022, 7:36 pm - ali: its not jealousyy broo
18/10/2022, 7:36 pm - ali: its moreso hatred that she does not get justice
18/10/2022, 7:36 pm - American Araiz: But I don’t think Rhaenyra has directly ever wronged alicent like that to where she would happily accept her getting murdered
18/10/2022, 7:36 pm - American Araiz: And entire family murdered
18/10/2022, 7:36 pm - ali: yea obvi but thts what the story is about, perception of truth
18/10/2022, 7:37 pm - ali: and book even is written in bias FOR the greens
18/10/2022, 7:37 pm - American Araiz: I guess I’ll find out as we progress but for now. I don’t have any issues with alicent and Rhaenyras relationship and their reasons for conflict and why they don’t hate each other as much as books from what ur saying
18/10/2022, 7:37 pm - American Araiz: I have issues with some other aspects of alicents character but not this one
18/10/2022, 7:38 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
18/10/2022, 7:38 pm - ali: does this change
18/10/2022, 7:38 pm - ali: bother u
18/10/2022, 7:38 pm - American Araiz: Explain this to me I didn’t understand this
18/10/2022, 7:38 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
18/10/2022, 7:40 pm - ali: sorry for long
18/10/2022, 7:40 pm - American Araiz: Np boo
18/10/2022, 7:42 pm - American Araiz: Then how are her and Otto any different at this point in the books
18/10/2022, 7:41 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
18/10/2022, 7:42 pm - American Araiz: I think after the dinner with viserys, alicents character softened up a bit
18/10/2022, 7:43 pm - American Araiz: She probably wants Aegon on the throne as much but in the show she reacted like this because she was being given no say in anything
18/10/2022, 7:43 pm - American Araiz: Otto was trying to control it behind her back
18/10/2022, 7:44 pm - American Araiz: Yes the misunderstanding is the biggest issue
18/10/2022, 7:43 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
18/10/2022, 7:44 pm - American Araiz: I think she must’ve gotten some affection for viserys over time
18/10/2022, 7:44 pm - American Araiz: With like the 4 time skips
18/10/2022, 7:44 pm - ali: if its not in book, or happens in time skips it's not well written lmao
18/10/2022, 7:45 pm - American Araiz: Yea but shit is off screened all the time in this show
18/10/2022, 7:45 pm - American Araiz: There’s so much stuff that happens offscreen
18/10/2022, 7:45 pm - ali: not important stuff?
18/10/2022, 7:45 pm - American Araiz: Alicent getting slightly attached to viserys is that important
18/10/2022, 7:46 pm - ali: the one thing  i genuinely believed s1 did was keep all important stuff on screen and skip the things that they can't afford to waste screen time on
18/10/2022, 7:46 pm - American Araiz: I think daemon laena and Aegon Helena marriages were way more important
18/10/2022, 7:46 pm - American Araiz: And those were off screened
18/10/2022, 7:46 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
18/10/2022, 7:47 pm - ali: nope cus u know daemon is gonna  marry rhayenar
18/10/2022, 7:47 pm - American Araiz: Ok then I think I like show approach more then. So what I understand from u is that in the books Otto manipulated alicent since childhood like in the show and makes her to everything according to his will and then they just cooperate and alicent is not pissed at him??
18/10/2022, 7:47 pm - American Araiz: Then Laena is a completely pointless character
18/10/2022, 7:47 pm - American Araiz: Yet she gets vhaegar
18/10/2022, 7:47 pm - American Araiz: Also offscreen
18/10/2022, 7:47 pm - ali: yeaa she kinda iss beoo
18/10/2022, 7:48 pm - American Araiz: I don’t really agree
18/10/2022, 7:48 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
18/10/2022, 7:49 pm - American Araiz: I think the flow of events has not been that off for me as a show only. Maybe ur book perspective is giving u a different opinion on this
18/10/2022, 7:49 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
18/10/2022, 7:50 pm - ali: i still love the show, but this is giving me bad anxiety for future seasons
18/10/2022, 7:51 pm - American Araiz: Reality is that some of these things have to be done for this to be successful as a live action. They have to make these shock factor scenes like rhaenys bursting out with dragon because there’s a big audience for this
18/10/2022, 7:51 pm - ali: so u want big actions scenes for sake of it?
18/10/2022, 7:51 pm - ali: got never was successful for its big action scenes
18/10/2022, 7:51 pm - American Araiz: I agree with some of the character motivation changes not being necessary
18/10/2022, 7:51 pm - ali: and neither was most of hotd
18/10/2022, 7:52 pm - American Araiz: I will still prioritize story and plot development but if this series didn’t have those big action set pieces then yes I would lose some of that interest
18/10/2022, 7:51 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
18/10/2022, 7:52 pm - ali: yaar
18/10/2022, 7:53 pm - American Araiz: True. But I think this show is a bit different in that regard. It being called house of dragon and set in the time where there are dozens of dragons. Ofc I’m gonna expect some good dragon scenes
18/10/2022, 7:53 pm - American Araiz: There was never that element in most of got
18/10/2022, 7:53 pm - American Araiz: Till the end
18/10/2022, 7:53 pm - ali: bro there are so many dragone scenes for s2 s3 the most, they have plenty of material to show off
18/10/2022, 7:53 pm - ali: thay actually makes sense
18/10/2022, 7:53 pm - ali: s1 was always meant to be a prolog of sorts
18/10/2022, 7:54 pm - American Araiz: Yea probably but they gotta appeal to mainstream audience who know nothing about books and gotta hook them on first season
18/10/2022, 7:54 pm - American Araiz: I don’t mind this because I’m more of a fantasy nerd
18/10/2022, 7:54 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
18/10/2022, 7:55 pm - ali: they're already hooked bro, first 6 eps has whole world
18/10/2022, 7:55 pm - ali: they don't need to shove dragons out of context to convince ppl anymore anymore
18/10/2022, 7:55 pm - American Araiz: This was more of a problem as dnd because that was the fucking finale of 10 years of work. Not the first season of a long ass project. And this rhaenys scene was not as big a deal as the stupid shit in S8
18/10/2022, 7:56 pm - ali: yea ofcourse but like i said this why im. nervous
18/10/2022, 7:56 pm - American Araiz: This is absolutely not the case for ppl who are not big fantasy ppl or book fans
18/10/2022, 7:56 pm - ali: if they think of makign decisions like these
18/10/2022, 7:56 pm - ali: bro what
18/10/2022, 7:56 pm - ali: it's literally biggest showe airing rn?
18/10/2022, 7:57 pm - ali: everyone is talking about jt
18/10/2022, 7:57 pm - American Araiz: True but u can’t expect where ppl will be hooked when making a season
18/10/2022, 7:57 pm - American Araiz: U don’t know which ep will make ppl committed for the long run
18/10/2022, 7:57 pm - ali: the 2nd last ep??? of the season?

the hook of the season is 2nd last ep?
18/10/2022, 7:57 pm - American Araiz: By u I mean as the show runners
18/10/2022, 7:58 pm - American Araiz: I personally view it as the whole first season
18/10/2022, 7:58 pm - American Araiz: Some people may be indifferent on the show by ep 5/6
18/10/2022, 7:58 pm - ali: haan obvi, but look at numbers vast majority are already hooked
18/10/2022, 7:58 pm - ali: by ep 5
18/10/2022, 7:59 pm - ali: im noy talkign bout minority
18/10/2022, 7:59 pm - American Araiz: Like this show was only just okay for me till the ep with Aemond losing eye
18/10/2022, 7:59 pm - American Araiz: Which was ep 6 or 7 I think
18/10/2022, 8:00 pm - American Araiz: I agree that sunfyre would’ve had the same impact tho
18/10/2022, 8:00 pm - American Araiz: So they probably should’ve done that
18/10/2022, 8:00 pm - ali: haan im not talking bout when it got good, im talkign that show needs to not shove random dragon scenes to hook ppl, there's plenty of more sensible places
18/10/2022, 8:00 pm - American Araiz: True true
18/10/2022, 8:00 pm - ali: like vhagar scene
or ceraxes syrax faceoff
18/10/2022, 8:00 pm - ali: there's plenty of changes i prefer to show
18/10/2022, 8:00 pm - ali: wayyy morre
18/10/2022, 8:00 pm - ali: than book
18/10/2022, 8:01 pm - ali: im sayin this cus i m not a book purist at all, but certain things like major plot points shouldn't be changed
18/10/2022, 8:01 pm - American Araiz: I think ending ep 9 with a big spectacle is important to build hype for the finale but it being Aegon and sunfyre would’ve had the same impact as what they actually did
18/10/2022, 8:01 pm - ali: yeaa
18/10/2022, 8:02 pm - American Araiz: Fair enough
18/10/2022, 8:02 pm - ali: they wanted their girl boss moment
18/10/2022, 8:02 pm - American Araiz: Slay queen 💅🏻
18/10/2022, 8:03 pm - American Araiz: Alicent saying to rhaenys that u should’ve been queen was 100% bullshit
18/10/2022, 8:03 pm - American Araiz: It was a last ditch effort to sweet talk her
18/10/2022, 8:03 pm - ali: lmaoo yea like be f
18/10/2022, 8:03 pm - ali: fr
18/10/2022, 8:03 pm - ali: rhaeyns was smart to not think too much on it
18/10/2022, 8:03 pm - ali: every mf says it to her
18/10/2022, 8:04 pm - American Araiz: Yea she has too much experience dealing with bullshit like this
18/10/2022, 8:05 pm - ali: starr this message next ep. is gonna be
18/10/2022, 8:05 pm - ali: ur fav
18/10/2022, 8:05 pm - ali: and prolly the best of the season
18/10/2022, 8:10 pm - American Araiz: Yea I can tell from the preview lol
18/10/2022, 8:11 pm - ali: i wish they kept that one scene
18/10/2022, 8:11 pm - American Araiz: I was making some coffee in the office
18/10/2022, 8:11 pm - American Araiz: It ended up being ass
18/10/2022, 8:11 pm - ali: of aegon sayin no to out of respect for rhayenar
18/10/2022, 8:11 pm - ali: office coffee ass

18/10/2022, 8:11 pm - ali: like uni coffee
18/10/2022, 8:11 pm - American Araiz: I keep thinking maybe it’ll be better the next time I try it
18/10/2022, 8:11 pm - ali: what about tea
18/10/2022, 8:11 pm - American Araiz: My mistake
18/10/2022, 8:12 pm - American Araiz: I’m even pickier with tea than I am with coffee
18/10/2022, 8:12 pm - American Araiz: I will only drink chai with everyday powder
18/10/2022, 8:13 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
18/10/2022, 8:13 pm - ali: lmaooo
18/10/2022, 8:13 pm - ali: history is misogynist
18/10/2022, 8:13 pm - American Araiz: Real

18/10/2022, 9:35 pm - American Araiz: Especially Aegon stuff
18/10/2022, 9:35 pm - American Araiz: Aegon in the show rn feels like a husk of a person

30/10/2022, 12:43 am - ali: has fun Easter eggs and
30/10/2022, 12:43 am - ali: quotes from movies
30/10/2022, 1:01 pm - American Araiz: Man I’m still so fucking pissed over this Witcher show bullshit
30/10/2022, 1:01 pm - American Araiz: Why is Henry cursed with getting awful writers and scripts
30/10/2022, 1:03 pm - American Araiz: I read that there was a scene he refused to do with how the writers wanted in S2. In s2 after a fight, his horse roach ends up dying and the writers wanted to squeeze in a joke for it. Henry refused because Geralt loves his horses and wanted the scene to be a burial for his horse
30/10/2022, 1:04 pm - American Araiz: And apparently this took a lot of convincing from him to make them do this scene
30/10/2022, 6:28 pm - ali: omg i read this on reddit
30/10/2022, 6:28 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
30/10/2022, 6:28 pm - ali: Hollywood is so fuckn stupid
30/10/2022, 6:28 pm - American Araiz: I’m so fucking mad
30/10/2022, 6:29 pm - American Araiz: Henry was literally perfect for the role
30/10/2022, 6:29 pm - American Araiz: He cared about the character so much
30/10/2022, 6:29 pm - ali: this is ur got s8
30/10/2022, 6:29 pm - American Araiz: It really is
30/10/2022, 6:29 pm - American Araiz: I had to deal with it once with got already
30/10/2022, 6:29 pm - ali: modern day writers don't care bout story
30/10/2022, 6:29 pm - American Araiz: But imo a recast for me is worse than bad writing
30/10/2022, 6:30 pm - ali: they care hour flashy fight scenes, cgi shit
30/10/2022, 6:30 pm - ali: and subversion
30/10/2022, 6:30 pm - American Araiz: Recast especially of the main fucking character
30/10/2022, 6:30 pm - American Araiz: Imagine Jon snow got recast for S8
30/10/2022, 6:30 pm - American Araiz: I genuinely wouldn’t have watched it
30/10/2022, 6:30 pm - ali: they could generate Geralt from book into real life and it wouldn't matter if the writing  is atrocious
30/10/2022, 6:31 pm - American Araiz: I guess but I still would’ve stuck with it if Henry was just being Geralt
30/10/2022, 6:31 pm - American Araiz: I enjoyed watching him as that character that much
30/10/2022, 6:31 pm - American Araiz: And pretty much every show viewer feels the same
30/10/2022, 6:31 pm - ali: so u wish henry had stayed
30/10/2022, 6:31 pm - ali: Depakote
30/10/2022, 6:31 pm - ali: despite
30/10/2022, 6:31 pm - ali: bad writing?
30/10/2022, 6:32 pm - American Araiz: No I think this is best for him
30/10/2022, 6:32 pm - American Araiz: Ideal solution is get new writers and showrunners
30/10/2022, 6:32 pm - American Araiz: Not a new fucking Lead actor
30/10/2022, 6:32 pm - ali: yea, why spent 6 days a week on shit that makes no sense, he defo knows this series isn't gonna end well if they're makign up their own shit and storylines
30/10/2022, 6:32 pm - ali: yea but ye tou almost impossible
30/10/2022, 6:33 pm - American Araiz: Yea. Whatever they made him do for S3 must’ve been his limit
30/10/2022, 6:33 pm - American Araiz: Why though
30/10/2022, 6:33 pm - American Araiz: Why is it so hard for the studio to say that the show runners/writers are not doing a good job
30/10/2022, 6:33 pm - American Araiz: And replace them
30/10/2022, 6:33 pm - American Araiz: Not a single fan will care
30/10/2022, 6:34 pm - ali: it's not about fans
30/10/2022, 6:34 pm - American Araiz: But every fan will be upset at actor changes
30/10/2022, 6:34 pm - American Araiz: Who the hell are they making the show for then
30/10/2022, 6:34 pm - ali: studios when they make green light
30/10/2022, 6:34 pm - ali: the show
30/10/2022, 6:34 pm - American Araiz: Un green light it if it’s in such shambles
30/10/2022, 6:34 pm - American Araiz: HBO and George should’ve stepped in with dnd too
30/10/2022, 6:34 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
30/10/2022, 6:36 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
30/10/2022, 6:37 pm - American Araiz: How do these studios accept this for entire shows and not individual seasons
30/10/2022, 6:37 pm - ali: its sad but Hollywood baby
30/10/2022, 6:37 pm - American Araiz: Why aren’t seasons pitched as it goes

30/10/2022, 6:38 pm - ali: it continues for a set time
30/10/2022, 6:38 pm - American Araiz: Bro Henry was so committed to this rule
30/10/2022, 6:38 pm - American Araiz: Role*
30/10/2022, 6:38 pm - American Araiz: He literally said he would even do Geralt and Superman at once if he had to
30/10/2022, 6:38 pm - American Araiz: Man is so passionate about this franchise
30/10/2022, 6:39 pm - American Araiz: Does Netflix really think viewership will maintain S4 and onward💀
30/10/2022, 6:38 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
30/10/2022, 6:39 pm - American Araiz: Witcher was supposed to be a 7 season project

30/10/2022, 6:41 pm - ali: lmaoo iss kya taluq ahaha
30/10/2022, 6:41 pm - American Araiz: Even though I like the other actors I will still not be watching S4

30/10/2022, 6:42 pm - American Araiz: Sorry bro he gotta catch some strays rn

30/10/2022, 6:43 pm - American Araiz: I think I generally disliked hunger games tbh
30/10/2022, 6:43 pm - ali: he's not gonna  live up to be Geralt
30/10/2022, 6:43 pm - American Araiz: But that brooding and stern nature is exactly perfect for Geralt
30/10/2022, 6:44 pm - ali: haan iss liye im sayin it shouldn't be too hard
30/10/2022, 6:44 pm - ali: especially with the 1 page

30/10/2022, 6:44 pm - American Araiz: This still requires acting?
30/10/2022, 6:44 pm - American Araiz: I mean I don’t even think that matters to the fans
30/10/2022, 6:44 pm - American Araiz: Henry was Geralt
30/10/2022, 6:44 pm - American Araiz: Period. No one could ever replace him for me

30/10/2022, 6:51 pm - American Araiz: And it’s so stupid
30/10/2022, 6:51 pm - American Araiz: The video game industry is infinitely bigger than book industry
30/10/2022, 6:51 pm - American Araiz: Like do u not like money???
30/10/2022, 6:51 pm - ali: what does that have to do

30/10/2022, 6:53 pm - ali: I read lawsuit and valid concern
30/10/2022, 6:54 pm - American Araiz: But like if an author wants to be such a video game hater and show hater. He can keep being a book purist and make literally 1% of that money
30/10/2022, 6:55 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
30/10/2022, 6:57 pm - American Araiz: I understand but even if it is his mind and material, he did not make that material successful

03/03/2023, 7:44 pm - ali: dodging doesn't work at akl
03/03/2023, 7:44 pm - American Araiz: Genshin combat feels so smooth. Once you get into the flow of elemental reactions, the game gets so fun
03/03/2023, 7:44 pm - ali: all
03/03/2023, 7:44 pm - American Araiz: Parrying sucks too
03/03/2023, 7:44 pm - ali: yes im getting into jumping in combat
03/03/2023, 7:44 pm - ali: before i just spammed O
03/03/2023, 7:44 pm - ali: and R2
03/03/2023, 7:44 pm - ali: idk name so bare with me
03/03/2023, 7:44 pm - American Araiz: Witcher May you do such less damage and enemies do so much
03/03/2023, 7:45 pm - American Araiz: O is basic attack combo. R2 is skill. Triangle is ultimate
03/03/2023, 7:45 pm - American Araiz: Dw bro I’m just excited to be able to play with someone lol
03/03/2023, 7:45 pm - American Araiz: Even on normal difficulty
03/03/2023, 7:46 pm - American Araiz: One piece of advice though. Once you unlock the wishing menu which lets you pull for new characters. I would recommend just doing the beginner banner for new characters because the currency used to get new characters is scarce
03/03/2023, 7:47 pm - ali: haa oki
03/03/2023, 7:47 pm - ali: also
03/03/2023, 7:47 pm - ali: is there a shortcut way to
03/03/2023, 7:47 pm - ali: use food to heal mid battle
03/03/2023, 7:47 pm - ali: or only way is going into inventory and healing
03/03/2023, 7:48 pm - American Araiz: Yes. Eventually you unlock an item where you can just press L1+O mid battle to heal
03/03/2023, 7:48 pm - ali: ha oke
03/03/2023, 7:48 pm - American Araiz: For now until you unlock that item but soon you’ll unlock some healer characters
03/03/2023, 7:48 pm - American Araiz: Like Noelle or Barbara
03/03/2023, 7:49 pm - ali: exciting
03/03/2023, 7:49 pm - American Araiz: Can’t wait to play online🤩

03/03/2023, 8:18 pm - American Araiz: Need to finish hogwarts legacy first
03/03/2023, 8:18 pm - American Araiz: The developers would be idiotic not to add multiplayer to that game in the future
03/03/2023, 8:19 pm - ali: haan
03/03/2023, 8:19 pm - ali: i don't wanna see a hogwarts legacy 2
03/03/2023, 8:20 pm - ali: but will buy it if it comes
03/03/2023, 8:20 pm - ali: im so happy
03/03/2023, 8:20 pm - ali: harry Potter world never dying
03/03/2023, 8:20 pm - ali: im genuinely surprised how popular it became
03/03/2023, 8:20 pm - American Araiz: This game has so much potential for dlc and multiplayer
03/03/2023, 8:20 pm - American Araiz: Same did not expect it to blow up this big outside of hp fandom
03/03/2023, 8:20 pm - American Araiz: The game having no quidditch is criminal
03/03/2023, 8:20 pm - ali: haha i thought same
03/03/2023, 8:21 pm - ali: i remember playing qudditch games
03/03/2023, 8:21 pm - ali: they were fun
03/03/2023, 8:21 pm - American Araiz: It needs to be introduced as a multiplayer thing
03/03/2023, 8:21 pm - ali: but i guess they need to devlop thr sport cus its kinda weird rules
03/03/2023, 8:21 pm - ali: seeker is mvp role
03/03/2023, 8:21 pm - ali: other roles in team like beater just be sittign and waiting
03/03/2023, 8:21 pm - ali: yea, only thing they'll have to add is time limit which doesn't exist in qudditch canon rules
03/03/2023, 8:22 pm - American Araiz: I’m not that familiar with the rules but it’d be nice if they could make it work somehow
03/03/2023, 8:23 pm - ali: yeaa
03/03/2023, 8:23 pm - ali: normal qudditch game ends when snitch is caught
03/03/2023, 8:24 pm - ali: lmaoo online multilayer itll never end
03/03/2023, 8:24 pm - American Araiz: Make it full simple chaos type like rocket league
03/03/2023, 8:24 pm - ali: or end too quickly
03/03/2023, 8:24 pm - ali: yess remove snitch
03/03/2023, 8:25 pm - American Araiz: It has so much potential. Just some sort of open world server like gta online
03/03/2023, 8:25 pm - American Araiz: With different mini games and stuff with houses
03/03/2023, 8:25 pm - ali: they can add fun Easter eggs
03/03/2023, 8:25 pm - ali: back story to alot of characters
03/03/2023, 8:26 pm - American Araiz: Yup
03/03/2023, 8:26 pm - ali: need genshin type updates for hogwarts legacy but thatll require good writers
03/03/2023, 8:26 pm - ali: and money
03/03/2023, 8:26 pm - American Araiz: Idk about that because genshin is a live service game
03/03/2023, 8:26 pm - American Araiz: It’s meant to be fully offline while hogwarts meant to be fully offline
03/03/2023, 8:26 pm - American Araiz: Like gta 5 was at launch
03/03/2023, 8:27 pm - American Araiz: They basically made gta online like another game to make it work
03/03/2023, 8:27 pm - ali: but they could add new storylines to offline game no?
03/03/2023, 8:27 pm - American Araiz: Meant to be fully online*
03/03/2023, 8:27 pm - American Araiz: Yes but that would just be dlc
03/03/2023, 8:27 pm - American Araiz: Idk how they would pull of multiplayer
03/03/2023, 8:27 pm - American Araiz: Single player
03/03/2023, 8:28 pm - American Araiz: Like genshin is a fully online game cannot be played without internet
03/03/2023, 8:29 pm - ali: they already have custom characters but haan
03/03/2023, 8:29 pm - ali: its a big task
03/03/2023, 8:29 pm - ali: maybe how well the game was received helps
03/03/2023, 8:29 pm - ali: me acting like they finna hire my ass to do it
03/03/2023, 8:30 pm - American Araiz: Yup
03/03/2023, 8:30 pm - American Araiz: 😭
03/03/2023, 8:30 pm - ali: gta online was such a gigachad brain move by Rockstar

03/03/2023, 8:31 pm - American Araiz: Game feels ridiculously slow
03/03/2023, 8:31 pm - American Araiz: It is a 2013 game after all

03/03/2023, 11:47 pm - American Araiz: That does big damage
03/03/2023, 11:48 pm - American Araiz: Also equip your characters with higher rarity weapons and artifacts if you have them
03/03/2023, 11:48 pm - American Araiz: And if it ain’t a story enemy you could just avoid for now
03/03/2023, 11:49 pm - American Araiz: Do you have any other characters yet except the first 4
03/03/2023, 11:50 pm - ali: GOT IT

03/03/2023, 11:51 pm - American Araiz: Another tip
03/03/2023, 11:51 pm - American Araiz: I think if you press L1+up or down you can open the tutorial menu and see enemy descriptions and weaknesses
03/03/2023, 11:51 pm - American Araiz: Some enemies have specific weaknesses
03/03/2023, 11:52 pm - ali: yess i read

03/03/2023, 11:52 pm - ali: i like long range plus her ultimate thing really good
03/03/2023, 11:53 pm - American Araiz: Yes having an archer in your squad is always very useful
03/03/2023, 11:54 pm - American Araiz: But once you get a new archer they will probably be much better than her
03/03/2023, 11:54 pm - American Araiz: Btw her R2 skill, the explosive bunny also locks onto enemy attacks for a bit

15/04/2023, 10:58 pm - American Araiz: I’m gonna say a hot take
15/04/2023, 10:58 pm - American Araiz: I think berserk would work better as a live action than an anime
15/04/2023, 10:58 pm - ali: yea hes edging u
15/04/2023, 10:58 pm - ali: no way
15/04/2023, 10:58 pm - ali: what makes u say that

15/04/2023, 10:58 pm - American Araiz: The content of the series lol
15/04/2023, 10:59 pm - American Araiz: It’s literally a mix of lord of the rings and game of thrones
15/04/2023, 10:59 pm - ali: its so gore and mythical creatures no?
15/04/2023, 10:59 pm - American Araiz: It is quite heavy on the gore but it is about same level of fantasy as lotr
15/04/2023, 10:59 pm - ali: yea two of the one of the most expensives live action medias ever
15/04/2023, 11:00 pm - American Araiz: Right so I can’t see berserk working at all without the biggest budget ever
15/04/2023, 11:00 pm - ali: yea

15/04/2023, 11:01 pm - American Araiz: If you like the live action I hope you will give the anime a shot
15/04/2023, 11:01 pm - American Araiz: It’s gonna be impossible for the live action to be better than the anime but I just hope it’s decent
15/04/2023, 11:04 pm - ali: yea just good enough
15/04/2023, 11:04 pm - ali: it can be like harry potter series or lotr live action
15/04/2023, 11:04 pm - ali: where source material obvi better
15/04/2023, 11:05 pm - ali: but live action has its own place and good enough
15/04/2023, 11:05 pm - American Araiz: Right, usually it’s really hard to be better than the source material
15/04/2023, 11:05 pm - ali: yea
15/04/2023, 11:05 pm - American Araiz: Unless the source material is really bad like the boys

15/04/2023, 11:06 pm - ali: yea

15/04/2023, 11:06 pm - American Araiz: I really hope the one piece live action uses some of the music from the anime
15/04/2023, 11:06 pm - American Araiz: Because the music is iconic
15/04/2023, 11:06 pm - ali: theyd be stupid not to
15/04/2023, 11:06 pm - American Araiz: Or at least does new versions of the same songs

They also did this opening song which is unironically a banger

12/09/2023, 9:33 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
12/09/2023, 9:35 pm - American Araiz: Agreed
12/09/2023, 9:35 pm - American Araiz: I think they executed most things perfectly
12/09/2023, 9:36 pm - American Araiz: The biggest complain I hear is definitely the marines taking up too much time which could’ve been used to develop Sanji and Nami more
12/09/2023, 9:36 pm - American Araiz: Which I’m also pretty split on because the marine plot was excellent
12/09/2023, 9:41 pm - ali: <Media omitted>

12/09/2023, 9:47 pm - American Araiz: There definitely isn’t a driving force in the anime like the marines. Everything feels moreso like building up the world and characters and setting up a foundation
12/09/2023, 9:47 pm - American Araiz: I think it feels this way till alabasta
12/09/2023, 9:50 pm - American Araiz: Did you watch zoro vs mihawk yet?

08/12/2023, 10:53 am - ali: not saying ppl loved it or not
08/12/2023, 10:53 am - ali: i just think oppenheimer was better movie for me
08/12/2023, 10:53 am - American Araiz: It was absolutely an objectively good movie tho
08/12/2023, 10:53 am - American Araiz: Sure that’s fine cause preference
08/12/2023, 10:53 am - ali: yea better than expectations, but v forgettable for me
08/12/2023, 10:53 am - ali: i just wish it wasnt so on the nose
08/12/2023, 10:53 am - American Araiz: Nah not even slightly forgettable for me
08/12/2023, 10:54 am - ali: it had such a good analysis going for it
08/12/2023, 10:55 am - American Araiz: It was the perfect balance of a good story and message plus fun comedy movie for me
08/12/2023, 10:56 am - American Araiz: Man it’s still criminal that u haven’t watched Loki
08/12/2023, 10:57 am - ali: eh superhero stuff
08/12/2023, 10:57 am - ali: not in mood
08/12/2023, 10:57 am - ali: invincible only ill watch#
08/12/2023, 10:57 am - American Araiz: Loki is barely a superhero show
08/12/2023, 10:58 am - American Araiz: Mid
08/12/2023, 10:58 am - ali: dont feel like im missing out
08/12/2023, 10:58 am - ali: or anything
08/12/2023, 10:58 am - ali: ik its good but marvel so
08/12/2023, 10:59 am - American Araiz: You absolutely are cause it’s amazing story and writing from marvel for once
08/12/2023, 11:00 am - American Araiz: Man people who become anti marvel now are so bitter and serious
08/12/2023, 11:00 am - American Araiz: U can acknowledge that most of their latest stuff has been trash but still watch some of the actual good things
08/12/2023, 11:01 am - ali: nobody HAS to watch anything bruh
08/12/2023, 11:01 am - American Araiz: If most people are calling something good it’s probably worth a watch
08/12/2023, 11:01 am - ali: being bitter/serious is a stupid logic just because someone doesnt like something u watch lmaoo
08/12/2023, 11:01 am - ali: i could call u bitter and serious for not liking aot
08/12/2023, 11:02 am - American Araiz: Aot is in my top 10 anime brother. I can love something and still dislike some parts like the ending
08/12/2023, 11:02 am - American Araiz: Aot and got are exact same parallel for me
08/12/2023, 11:02 am - American Araiz: I think not liking something after watching it is fine. Not liking something without watching it is stupid
08/12/2023, 11:03 am - ali: marvel has got superhero fatigue, same as mob movies did in 2000s, ppl/me are excited for other stuff like D&d, Oppy, killers , etc movies that dont get made as often now
08/12/2023, 11:03 am - ali: i didnt say i didnt like loki bruh, i just dont feel like watching loki
08/12/2023, 11:03 am - American Araiz: DND WAS SO FIRE
08/12/2023, 11:03 am - ali: why would i watch something im not in a mood for,#
08/12/2023, 11:03 am - American Araiz: agreed with the superhero fatigue tho
08/12/2023, 11:04 am - ali: like im so serious antman3, thor 4 were WORSE than phase 1 ki mid movies
08/12/2023, 11:04 am - American Araiz: Cause i thought u were cause u watched a few eps
08/12/2023, 11:04 am - ali: secret invasion too
08/12/2023, 11:04 am - American Araiz: Absolutely agreed
08/12/2023, 11:04 am - American Araiz: Thor 4 is the worst marvel movie ever imo
08/12/2023, 11:04 am - ali: by far
08/12/2023, 11:04 am - ali: thor 2 was much better, also severly mid but cgi and fight scenes are amazing
08/12/2023, 11:05 am - American Araiz: Ngl I don’t remember shit about it
08/12/2023, 11:05 am - American Araiz: But I remember it being not as bad
08/12/2023, 11:05 am - American Araiz: Thor 4 I wanted to leave cinema during movie and I’ve never done this
08/12/2023, 11:06 am - ali: insane man
08/12/2023, 11:07 am - ali: im so happy ppl finally have developed their frontal lobe and appreciating isayamas story and ending
08/12/2023, 11:07 am - ali: moreso mappa for coming in clutch and aniamting it with Gods strength
08/12/2023, 11:07 am - American Araiz: Once I finally get in the mood to watch it maybe I’ll change my mind too lmao
08/12/2023, 11:07 am - ali: this is ur ultimate media literacy test
08/12/2023, 11:07 am - ali: u dont have to LOVE it
08/12/2023, 11:08 am - ali: but idk what ppl expected to happen vs what did happen
08/12/2023, 11:08 am - American Araiz: To be fair I didn’t despise the manga ending either
08/12/2023, 11:08 am - American Araiz: I just felt disappointed
08/12/2023, 11:08 am - ali: yea i think thats the intention
08/12/2023, 11:08 am - American Araiz: Some aspects felt rushed and not satisfying
08/12/2023, 11:08 am - ali: no fairytale endiing, eren lost and won at the same time
08/12/2023, 11:08 am - American Araiz: Eren dying I wanted to happen the whole time I just didn’t like how it happened
08/12/2023, 11:09 am - ali: mikasa was perfect choice
08/12/2023, 11:09 am - American Araiz: I’m sick so I’m home so I’ll probably watch the finale
08/12/2023, 11:09 am - ali: mirroring their relationshiop with ymir and her king
08/12/2023, 11:09 am - American Araiz: ?
08/12/2023, 11:09 am - American Araiz: Clarify this because I don’t agree
08/12/2023, 11:10 am - ali: ymir fritz
08/12/2023, 11:10 am - American Araiz: How is the king and Ymir a parallel to mikasa and eren
08/12/2023, 11:10 am - American Araiz: Just the fact that they killed the other?
08/12/2023, 11:11 am - American Araiz: The king killed Ymir out of fear and hate and selfishness 

Mikasa killed eren while she loved him and to save the world
08/12/2023, 11:12 am - ali: tldr: Ymirs love for eldian king allowed her to be used and abused by him, she could never escape her curse regardless after her death cus she could no dissociate her love being in form of abuse, mikasa and eren are similar in that mikasa would literally do anything and everything regardless of erens action, EXCEPT at the end when she finally overcomes and does the necessary evil of killin eren
08/12/2023, 11:12 am - ali: ur literally there bro!!!
08/12/2023, 11:12 am - American Araiz: Ok that’s a great answer i agree
08/12/2023, 11:12 am - American Araiz: U cooked for once
08/12/2023, 11:14 am - ali: ahah
08/12/2023, 11:14 am - ali: aot is great man, only real flaw is isayamas art style
08/12/2023, 11:14 am - ali: but hey story is banger so ill let it slide
08/12/2023, 11:14 am - American Araiz: I do think the conclusions for some of the side characters were not satisfying for me as per the manga ending 

Good:
Zeke
Levi
Falco
Gabi
Annie
Reiner
Jean

Bad:
Mikasa
Armin
Hange
08/12/2023, 11:14 am - ali: i think his art style works for animation not manga, got in anime all the characters are so expressive
08/12/2023, 11:15 am - American Araiz: Man I fucking hate his art. I think aot anime is the only medium to consume this series
08/12/2023, 11:15 am - ali: and u can feel and see all emotions on characters
08/12/2023, 11:15 am - ali: i put mikasa in same bucket as eren as yea they didnt get their good ending but that was kinda the point i think?
08/12/2023, 11:17 am - American Araiz: I don’t mean good in the literally sense I mean in the sense that if I found it good lol. I just found mikasa’s character development very nonexistent throughout the series and it crammed too suddenly at the end
08/12/2023, 11:17 am - American Araiz: Also I hope anime changes my mind but that scene of eren crying to armin about loving mikasa gotta one of my most hated scenes in anime ever
08/12/2023, 11:25 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
08/12/2023, 11:54 am - American Araiz: I have to say this one last time for jjk S2 because of what happens in next weeks episode

08/12/2023, 6:50 pm - American Araiz: I enjoyed it in the manga but I know I’m gonna love it in the anime

17/01/2024, 11:08 am - ali: allegedly
17/01/2024, 11:08 am - American Araiz: The way kenjaku died if he really is dead was extremely underwhelming
17/01/2024, 11:08 am - ali: unless merger causes some insane shit
17/01/2024, 11:08 am - ali: no chance
17/01/2024, 11:08 am - American Araiz: ???
17/01/2024, 11:09 am - American Araiz: One piece truly gonna outlast all the new gens lol
17/01/2024, 11:09 am - ali: theory that merger might bring some sorceress back or some plot twist

17/01/2024, 11:10 am - American Araiz: For killing my pookie gojo
17/01/2024, 11:11 am - American Araiz: If I’ve invested this long into the series from day 1 ofc I’m gonna stay to the end even if I don’t like the direction the final arc went in
17/01/2024, 11:11 am - ali: ok REAL
17/01/2024, 11:12 am - American Araiz: If yuta vs Sukuna is proper fight chapters I’m gonna be invested again
18/01/2024, 12:17 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
18/01/2024, 12:20 am - American Araiz: Why does jjk have two covers😭

18/01/2024, 6:03 pm - ali: man luffy can win any year dawg
18/01/2024, 6:03 pm - American Araiz: Compared to these three I didn’t see a single category where I would’ve voted for aot instead
18/01/2024, 6:04 pm - ali: he probs got 24 nominations and goin
18/01/2024, 6:04 pm - American Araiz: Mainly because only the final movie was up for the category
18/01/2024, 6:04 pm - American Araiz: Nah one piece was only nominated for these 4
18/01/2024, 6:04 pm - ali: i mean previous years
18/01/2024, 6:04 pm - American Araiz: Weekly anime don’t qualify for most categories
18/01/2024, 6:04 pm - American Araiz: Yeah so it needs to win every year
18/01/2024, 6:04 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
18/01/2024, 6:04 pm - American Araiz: Aot sweeped like multiple years too
18/01/2024, 6:05 pm - American Araiz: When S3 and 4 were airing
19/01/2024, 12:57 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
19/01/2024, 9:46 am - ali: hes so him
19/01/2024, 9:46 am - ali: i really liked sukunas monologue
19/01/2024, 9:49 am - American Araiz: Same I enjoyed it
19/01/2024, 9:49 am - American Araiz: Yuta better cook next chapter
19/01/2024, 9:50 am - American Araiz: I rewatched all of one piece live action action these last three days lol
19/01/2024, 9:50 am - American Araiz: So good
19/01/2024, 9:50 am - American Araiz: Was my fourth rewatch🫣
19/01/2024, 10:01 am - ali: i still believe sukuna is gonna kill everyone
19/01/2024, 10:01 am - ali: and then merger is gonna bring them all back or some twist
19/01/2024, 10:01 am - ali: banger show
19/01/2024, 10:02 am - American Araiz: Same
19/01/2024, 10:03 am - American Araiz: I feel like that would drag out the ending in a similar way to how kaguya did in Naruto
19/01/2024, 11:28 am - ali: lowkey yes, but jjk is the exception since the series is so short man like ill take any more content
19/01/2024, 11:29 am - American Araiz: Idk man I would’ve loved an additional arc or two before shibuya
19/01/2024, 11:29 am - American Araiz: I think that would’ve been great for some more character development and more content
19/01/2024, 11:29 am - ali: yes thats my only wish, the 1 month gap between gojo revival and shinjuku showdown, i wish wasnt a time skip
19/01/2024, 11:29 am - American Araiz: Dragging out ending is like one of the biggest sins of a bad ending
19/01/2024, 11:29 am - ali: even tho sukuna vs gojo was generational and lived up to the hype, i wouldve waited regardless
19/01/2024, 11:29 am - American Araiz: Yeah same
19/01/2024, 11:30 am - ali: especially since gege is good writer, theres not a single arc i can say i felt like was killing time so ik the 1 month if he made into an arc would have been good
19/01/2024, 11:30 am - American Araiz: I think a slightly lengthy arc before shibuya and then a mini one between the one month gap would’ve done wonders for the series
19/01/2024, 11:30 am - ali: lowkey feel gege doesnt like jjk as much as we do lmaoo
19/01/2024, 11:30 am - American Araiz: Absolutely
19/01/2024, 11:30 am - ali: isnt this the opposite? like i feel like hes rushing the ending
19/01/2024, 11:30 am - ali: like rn
19/01/2024, 11:31 am - American Araiz: No I mean if he does the merger thing
19/01/2024, 11:31 am - American Araiz: That would drag it would
19/01/2024, 11:31 am - American Araiz: Rn yes it’s being rushed lol
19/01/2024, 11:31 am - ali: hmm thats interesting thought, rn id prefer more chapters in whole merger than it just ending in like 3 months
19/01/2024, 11:32 am - American Araiz: I think you defo like his writing more than me. I prefer his character writing that his actual plot and worldbuidling. He excels in making great characters and also one of the best battle manga authors
19/01/2024, 11:32 am - ali: since i still feel like jjk universe has so much to show, unlike naruto we're not 700 chapters into final arc
19/01/2024, 11:32 am - ali: i agree with this
19/01/2024, 11:32 am - ali: his world building is good but he just doesnt do enough
19/01/2024, 11:32 am - American Araiz: I think we still have at least 1-2 years more of content
19/01/2024, 11:33 am - ali: like the little he did, i still liked it, introducing kashimo and old sorcerers,
19/01/2024, 11:33 am - ali: he just edges
19/01/2024, 11:33 am - ali: like teasing about hein era
19/01/2024, 11:33 am - ali: rather than showing
19/01/2024, 11:33 am - American Araiz: This is just a me thing but I think when series or media is set in the real world and not a fictional world it automatically restricts the potential of worldbuilding
19/01/2024, 11:33 am - American Araiz: Man
19/01/2024, 11:33 am - ali: either hes not that interested in doing flashbacks, even tho hidden inventory was a A+++++++++ arc
19/01/2024, 11:33 am - American Araiz: I wish he fucking did a mini arc on that like hidden inventory
19/01/2024, 11:34 am - ali: like hidden inventory is up there with shibuya
19/01/2024, 11:34 am - ali: for me
19/01/2024, 11:34 am - American Araiz: Hidden inventory probably my second fav after shibuya
19/01/2024, 11:35 am - American Araiz: I just hope S3 isn’t ages away tho. I like jjk so much more in anime form than manga
19/01/2024, 11:40 am - ali: real
19/01/2024, 11:40 am - ali: jjk i love even more cus of their fandom
19/01/2024, 11:40 am - ali: like the hype around leaks and memes evrey week and ppls discussion and delusions is so fun
19/01/2024, 11:41 am - ali: compared to a certain other mangaka named fujimoto 😓😓😓
19/01/2024, 11:41 am - American Araiz: Me with op
19/01/2024, 11:41 am - American Araiz: Lmaoo
19/01/2024, 11:41 am - American Araiz: Csm manga seems to be struggling to reach the highs of the jjk manga or even the csm anime
19/01/2024, 11:42 am - ali: yea
19/01/2024, 11:42 am - ali: jjk is too high rn for csm
19/01/2024, 11:42 am - ali: csm i love so so much but fujimoto has slowed down in chapters
19/01/2024, 11:45 am - American Araiz: If I felt that in early part 2 then I worry how slow it’s gotten now
19/01/2024, 11:51 am - ali: he just doesnt release chapters often enough
19/01/2024, 11:51 am - ali: dudes on his 5th break week in 1.5 month
19/01/2024, 11:51 am - ali: like that will kill momentum in fandom
19/01/2024, 11:52 am - ali: especially since he left on a cliffhanger
19/01/2024, 11:52 am - ali: which i cant complain, writing manga is hard and he shouldnt overwork, but actions have consequences
19/01/2024, 11:52 am - American Araiz: I’m never going to hold release schedules on authors. I’ve been a animanga fan long enough and seen so many authors have their health destroyed by these strict schedules
19/01/2024, 11:52 am - ali: jjk and OP dont have to worry about break weeks cus fandom is batshit insane
19/01/2024, 11:53 am - American Araiz: Authors can take any amount of breaks they want except George and his decade break
19/01/2024, 11:53 am - ali: hahaha he has been writing so
19/01/2024, 11:53 am - ali: in that decade he did write mutliple GOT episodes, 4 books and winds of winter
19/01/2024, 11:53 am - American Araiz: Op fans also have like a million other sources of op to consume lol
19/01/2024, 11:54 am - American Araiz: Anime remake and live action s2 soon as well
19/01/2024, 11:54 am - American Araiz: Manga has been so peak man and not many breaks from oda either lately
19/01/2024, 11:54 am - ali: is gojo the most popular supporting character an anime has had
19/01/2024, 11:54 am - American Araiz: Yes definitely
19/01/2024, 11:54 am - ali: maybe sasuke is up there
19/01/2024, 11:54 am - ali: vegeta aswell
19/01/2024, 11:54 am - American Araiz: Not even close imo
19/01/2024, 11:55 am - American Araiz: If we’re talking all time top 5 is probably 
Gojo
Vegeta
Zoro
Sanji 
Sasuke
19/01/2024, 11:56 am - American Araiz: But I don’t think anyone has gotten as popular as gojo
19/01/2024, 11:56 am - ali: yea
19/01/2024, 11:56 am - ali: amongst all of these
19/01/2024, 11:56 am - ali: gojo has the least screentime
19/01/2024, 11:56 am - ali: aswell
19/01/2024, 11:56 am - ali: lmaoo

19/01/2024, 9:29 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
19/01/2024, 9:31 pm - American Araiz: I would hate it being a movie I don’t like the movie trend of anime
19/01/2024, 9:31 pm - ali: same
19/01/2024, 9:31 pm - American Araiz: And it’s becoming a very common trend
19/01/2024, 9:31 pm - ali: jjk0 only one that made sense to me

19/01/2024, 9:33 pm - American Araiz: But doesn’t seem like a thing with new anime
19/01/2024, 9:33 pm - American Araiz: Couldn’t be my goat oda
19/01/2024, 9:33 pm - American Araiz: Same I don’t understand either
19/01/2024, 9:34 pm - American Araiz: I’ll watch it nonetheless but it’s a weird creative decision
19/01/2024, 9:34 pm - American Araiz: Can’t wait to have to sit in a cinema full of people to watch two teenagers play around naked in a pool
19/01/2024, 9:34 pm - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
19/01/2024, 9:34 pm - ali: FR
19/01/2024, 9:34 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
19/01/2024, 9:36 pm - American Araiz: Valid Criticism
19/01/2024, 9:36 pm - American Araiz: Even after movie S2 has to be 24 eps to cover all of part 1
19/01/2024, 9:36 pm - ali: yesss
19/01/2024, 9:36 pm - American Araiz: If it’s 12 eps again it won’t even finish part 1
19/01/2024, 9:37 pm - ali: yea it would end right at gun devil reveal
19/01/2024, 9:37 pm - ali: cus international assasins is quite long compared to other arcs
19/01/2024, 9:38 pm - American Araiz: Idk if this is just a me thing but arc names is new anime don’t feel like a thing
19/01/2024, 9:38 pm - American Araiz: Like this is the actual arc name
19/01/2024, 9:39 pm - ali: really
19/01/2024, 9:39 pm - American Araiz: Like in jjk shibuya and culling games are the only main arcs with names
19/01/2024, 9:39 pm - American Araiz: But like Naruto and one piece. Everything is a distinct arc
19/01/2024, 9:39 pm - American Araiz: Is it really an arc if it’s like 4 eps or like 15 chaps long
19/01/2024, 9:39 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
19/01/2024, 9:40 pm - ali: i guess it still is, cus  arcs technically like seasons of a show
19/01/2024, 9:40 pm - ali: but difference is that arcs vary in length
19/01/2024, 9:40 pm - American Araiz: Demon slayer community definitely made arcs more distinct
19/01/2024, 9:40 pm - ali: no technically they all have names
19/01/2024, 9:40 pm - ali: just some are popular
19/01/2024, 9:40 pm - ali: like hidden inventory arc
19/01/2024, 9:41 pm - American Araiz: Yes but I’m saying I’ve never heard anyone refer to anything aside from hidden inventory, shibuya and culling games
19/01/2024, 9:41 pm - American Araiz: Like what arc would u call the events of S1
19/01/2024, 9:41 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
19/01/2024, 9:42 pm - American Araiz: Some media sources like crunchyroll and viz do label by arcs
19/01/2024, 9:42 pm - ali: like todoyuji vs hanami wala
19/01/2024, 9:42 pm - American Araiz: Again it’s usually the community who adopts the arc names
19/01/2024, 9:42 pm - ali: was kyoto goodwill arc
19/01/2024, 9:43 pm - American Araiz: I’ve never heard anyone ever say this😭

19/01/2024, 9:44 pm - American Araiz: I’m lowkey enjoying delicious in dungeon and solo leveling a lot weekly
19/01/2024, 9:44 pm - ali: probs linked to newer animanga being better paced

19/01/2024, 9:44 pm - ali: still havent watched ep2 of either
19/01/2024, 9:45 pm - American Araiz: Eh that’s debatable

26/01/2024, 8:58 pm - ali: banger
26/01/2024, 9:13 pm - American Araiz: So are we never going to get any closure between the fact that kenjaku is yujis mother now that kenjaku is dead
26/01/2024, 9:13 pm - American Araiz: So yuji is never finding out who his mother was I guess
26/01/2024, 9:13 pm - ali: idk why ppl believe kenjaku is dead dead, that makes me believe gege is ending the manga in next 10 chaptesr
26/01/2024, 9:13 pm - ali: which he defo isnt
26/01/2024, 9:13 pm - ali: ill be very suprised if he does
26/01/2024, 9:14 pm - ali: higher chance gojo doesnt come back than kenjaku staying dead
26/01/2024, 9:14 pm - American Araiz: I doubt he’s dead as well but I’m worried about how gege will do this without it being an asspull
26/01/2024, 9:15 pm - American Araiz: No chapter this week right?
26/01/2024, 9:15 pm - ali: no no we getting one

26/01/2024, 9:16 pm - ali: csm and gege in same week for first time in ages it feels like
26/01/2024, 9:16 pm - American Araiz: Man I might end up dropping if he keeps pointlessly killing characters
26/01/2024, 9:16 pm - American Araiz: Yuta needs more screentime and relevance desperately
26/01/2024, 9:17 pm - American Araiz: I keep watching clips of hidden inventory and miss it so much man
26/01/2024, 9:17 pm - ali: he got alot in culling games but yea

26/01/2024, 9:17 pm - ali: i just want more chapters in general
26/01/2024, 9:18 pm - ali: so far only nobaras death is waht makes me iffy if gege actually makes it permanent
26/01/2024, 9:18 pm - American Araiz: I just want some better writing and less sukana plot armor. I wish higarumas “death” and yuji attacking with the executioners blade meant something
26/01/2024, 9:18 pm - American Araiz: Man Idek anymore
26/01/2024, 9:19 pm - American Araiz: Nobara and megumi gonna be in limbo forever it feels like

26/01/2024, 9:45 pm - ali: let me know if it is
26/01/2024, 9:45 pm - American Araiz: From trailer I’m excited. My only worry is sokka
26/01/2024, 9:45 pm - American Araiz: His actor doesn’t seem right for the role
26/01/2024, 9:46 pm - ali: the animated show is literally 10/10 so i dont have a reason to watch this
26/01/2024, 9:46 pm - American Araiz: Still a month away but will do
26/01/2024, 9:46 pm - ali: trailers didnt move me
26/01/2024, 9:46 pm - ali: only daniel dae kim
26/01/2024, 9:46 pm - ali: as ozai moved me
26/01/2024, 9:46 pm - American Araiz: More of the media I love is always better for me

26/01/2024, 9:47 pm - American Araiz: Zuko and aang look perfect
26/01/2024, 9:47 pm - ali: 3 seasons of animated show we didnt even see his face or voice LMAOO
26/01/2024, 9:47 pm - American Araiz: True
26/01/2024, 9:48 pm - ali: HOWW
26/01/2024, 9:48 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
26/01/2024, 9:48 pm - ali: its literally praised all the time on my TL
26/01/2024, 9:48 pm - ali: who is sleeping on this
26/01/2024, 9:48 pm - American Araiz: 1.3k views for a reason
26/01/2024, 9:49 pm - ali: manga fans with victim complex will kill me one day
26/01/2024, 9:49 pm - American Araiz: It is slept on tho it’s not nearly as popular as like dozens of other series
26/01/2024, 9:49 pm - ali: kagura bachi fans know their story is mid and gonna get cancelled and yet meme themselves everyday
26/01/2024, 9:49 pm - American Araiz: And no anime adaptation yet. That’s the biggest indicator
26/01/2024, 9:50 pm - ali: 1000% it gets announced this year#
26/01/2024, 9:54 pm - ali: its crazy how i read 140 chapters of csm in a day, and 240ish chapters of jjk in a week
26/01/2024, 9:55 pm - ali: and im still a month into 100 chapters of undead unluck
26/01/2024, 9:55 pm - American Araiz: Try 330 chapters of berserk in a day
26/01/2024, 9:55 pm - ali: that sounds tiring
26/01/2024, 9:55 pm - American Araiz: Yeah buddy idk if u were cooking with that recommendation
26/01/2024, 9:55 pm - American Araiz: It was exhausting but so worth
26/01/2024, 9:56 pm - American Araiz: Read for like 16 hours straight
26/01/2024, 9:56 pm - ali: it still really good!!!
26/01/2024, 9:56 pm - American Araiz: Will give the anime a shot for sure but again I’m not in shounen mood rn
26/01/2024, 9:56 pm - ali: berserk chapters take longer cus u gotta spend atleast extra 2 mins understanding whats even happening in the panel
26/01/2024, 9:56 pm - American Araiz: Frieren blew me away. It feels like such a classical fantasy like lotr
26/01/2024, 9:56 pm - ali: atleast on phone for me
26/01/2024, 9:56 pm - American Araiz: And chapters are also like 50 pages long
26/01/2024, 9:57 pm - ali: manga or anime?
26/01/2024, 9:57 pm - American Araiz: Anime
26/01/2024, 9:57 pm - American Araiz: Once the season of anime ends I might switch to manga idk yet
26/01/2024, 9:57 pm - American Araiz: But it’s such a refreshing anime compared to everything else lately
26/01/2024, 9:57 pm - American Araiz: Such solid writing and storytelling
26/01/2024, 10:00 pm - American Araiz: Man as much as it hurts me to say this the more I’m watching and reading more stuff the more I’m starting to dislike jjk. Mainly the current stuff in the manga
26/01/2024, 10:01 pm - ali: Huh????
26/01/2024, 10:01 pm - American Araiz: The memes on TikTok and twitter are peak tho
26/01/2024, 10:01 pm - ali: ur alone on this man
26/01/2024, 10:01 pm - ali: latest chapter was banger
26/01/2024, 10:01 pm - American Araiz: Banger is an overstatement. It was definitely better than some of the recent ones
26/01/2024, 10:02 pm - American Araiz: I just don’t understand where gege is taking the story anymore. It feels like it should end in like 10 chapters with sukuna winning
26/01/2024, 10:02 pm - ali: its weeekly man, obvi ur not gonna randomly get the answer in a single day
26/01/2024, 10:02 pm - ali: especially after u binged all of jjk in september
26/01/2024, 10:03 pm - American Araiz: Yeah I guess
26/01/2024, 10:03 pm - ali: if shibuya arc u were reading weekly, youd say why is mahito winning for 10 chapters straight
26/01/2024, 10:03 pm - ali: until banger ending
26/01/2024, 10:03 pm - American Araiz: I think that’s my issue with jjk. The villians have way too much plot armor
26/01/2024, 10:04 pm - American Araiz: Mahito kenjaku and Sukuna kings of plot armor
26/01/2024, 10:04 pm - ali: sukuna has
26/01/2024, 10:04 pm - ali: kenjaku considereing he died
26/01/2024, 10:04 pm - ali: by bush camper
26/01/2024, 10:04 pm - ali: is crazy lmaoo
26/01/2024, 10:04 pm - ali: if he actually died
26/01/2024, 10:04 pm - American Araiz: He ain’t
26/01/2024, 10:05 pm - ali: i guess for me its refereshing that in jjk the stakes are really high
26/01/2024, 10:05 pm - American Araiz: Also he should’ve died to yuki not the fucking stupid irrelevant comedian character. Yuta with a nice spawn camp tho
26/01/2024, 10:05 pm - ali: like u genuinly fear for each character
26/01/2024, 10:05 pm - ali: which in most stories u know good guys arent gonna die
26/01/2024, 10:05 pm - American Araiz: It was initially but not anymore. Now it’s just killing characters for the sake of killing them and I’m numb to it now
26/01/2024, 10:05 pm - ali: i personally did like takaba vs kenjaku as a chapter run, if he actually did die the way he did id be vvv upset tho
26/01/2024, 10:06 pm - American Araiz: Yes this was me I’m shibuya and somewhat culling games
26/01/2024, 10:06 pm - American Araiz: But now after gojo died, every other character is just an ant to Sukuna
26/01/2024, 10:06 pm - American Araiz: And Sukuna is now way stronger than when he fought gojo😭
26/01/2024, 10:07 pm - ali: with no DE
26/01/2024, 10:07 pm - ali: or mahoraga
26/01/2024, 10:07 pm - ali: or agito
26/01/2024, 10:07 pm - American Araiz: Tf is that
26/01/2024, 10:07 pm - ali: the 10 shadows thing
26/01/2024, 10:07 pm - ali: that sukuna combined
26/01/2024, 10:07 pm - ali: 3v1 jo tha
26/01/2024, 10:07 pm - American Araiz: Didn’t even know it had a name
26/01/2024, 10:07 pm - ali: tu parta nahi hai manga sahi sey
26/01/2024, 10:07 pm - ali: im fearing
26/01/2024, 10:08 pm - ali: i agree that as an arc, shinjuku showdown was unique/weird, considering its started off with the gojo sukuna  lmaoo
26/01/2024, 10:08 pm - American Araiz: U know I’ve said I’m not the biggest fan of jjk as a manga I prefer it as an anime. There’s so much dialogue and pages I’ve skipped in the manga💀
26/01/2024, 10:09 pm - American Araiz: Those 10ish chapters were so peak man we ain’t ever reaching a high like that again
26/01/2024, 10:09 pm - ali: man manga hai not coloring book, action key elawa bhi kuch hota hai
26/01/2024, 10:09 pm - ali: aise tou na ban
26/01/2024, 10:10 pm - American Araiz: Yaar u know I already have gripes with gege ki storytelling sometimes and the manga medium does not do it much favors. Gege excels in action scene for me more than anything else. He did in characters too but that doesn’t really matter anymore cause they are all either dead or forgotten
26/01/2024, 10:11 pm - American Araiz: Bro I caught up the Boruto manga also
26/01/2024, 10:11 pm - American Araiz: I have never wanted to hate so hard in my life
26/01/2024, 10:11 pm - ali: LMAOO
26/01/2024, 10:11 pm - ali: ppl seem to like recent chapters??
26/01/2024, 10:12 pm - American Araiz: Im seeing mostly mixed opinions
26/01/2024, 10:12 pm - American Araiz: There’s some good things for sure
26/01/2024, 10:12 pm - American Araiz: But some such awful dogshit things
26/01/2024, 10:12 pm - American Araiz: Have u seen what the new villains look like
26/01/2024, 10:13 pm - ali: noo
26/01/2024, 10:13 pm - ali: show
26/01/2024, 10:13 pm - American Araiz: Some of the worst character designs I’ve seen in my life
26/01/2024, 10:13 pm - ali: or name
26/01/2024, 10:13 pm - ali: ill google
26/01/2024, 10:13 pm - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
26/01/2024, 10:13 pm - American Araiz: Left one is a clone of sasuke
26/01/2024, 10:13 pm - ali: u didnt like sukunas monologue recent chapter main?
26/01/2024, 10:14 pm - American Araiz: That I really enjoyed
26/01/2024, 10:14 pm - ali: i mean they look like the other otusukis
26/01/2024, 10:14 pm - American Araiz: Definitely one of the best things from recent jjk chapters
26/01/2024, 10:14 pm - ali: ill never read boruto in general so
26/01/2024, 10:14 pm - American Araiz: Man none of these mfs reaching the aura that characters like pain and madara had😭
26/01/2024, 10:15 pm - ali: naruto as a world or power system doesnt move me enough to continue
26/01/2024, 10:15 pm - American Araiz: COOK
26/01/2024, 10:15 pm - ali: LMAOO
26/01/2024, 10:15 pm - American Araiz: I’m literally only continuing the manga because I’ve been a Naruto fan since I was 7
26/01/2024, 10:15 pm - ali: kishimoto writing itachi vs sasuke arc and then pain arc back to back was kinda crazy
26/01/2024, 10:15 pm - American Araiz: I’m in for the long run no matter how much it’s derailed and gone to shit
26/01/2024, 10:15 pm - American Araiz: Best arc in Naruto hands down
26/01/2024, 10:15 pm - ali: reall, i just dont consider boruto in my love for naruto
26/01/2024, 10:16 pm - American Araiz: Yeah all it’s been doing is tainting what I enjoyed from the original Naruto lol
26/01/2024, 10:16 pm - American Araiz: Boruto has literally become an edgelord carbon copy of sasuke
26/01/2024, 10:16 pm - ali: cus imo nothing will ever top sasuke naruto relationship, the sanins relationship, akatsuki formation, obito etc
26/01/2024, 10:16 pm - ali: uff
26/01/2024, 10:17 pm - American Araiz: Yeah it’s just being milked for money at this point
26/01/2024, 10:17 pm - ali: why does sarada wear glassese
26/01/2024, 10:17 pm - ali: is there lore reason
26/01/2024, 10:17 pm - American Araiz: Nope
26/01/2024, 10:17 pm - ali: she does not have that shit ON
26/01/2024, 10:17 pm - American Araiz: She also awakened her magenkyo by crying over Boruto because he was assumed dead
26/01/2024, 10:18 pm - American Araiz: Literally Sakura carbon copy
26/01/2024, 10:18 pm - ali: i mean it makes senses realistically since 70% of uchihas were like blind

26/01/2024, 10:18 pm - American Araiz: Only interesting character in the series is kawaki
26/01/2024, 10:18 pm - ali: whats her ability
26/01/2024, 10:19 pm - American Araiz: We haven’t seen her use the magenkyo yet but as a ninja she is just strong like Sakura and can use fire style and chidori like sasuke
26/01/2024, 10:19 pm - ali: oh damn
26/01/2024, 10:19 pm - ali: didnt ppl get memory

26/01/2024, 10:20 pm - American Araiz: Whole world got memory altered into thinking Boruto was always Kawaki and kawaki was Boruto
26/01/2024, 10:20 pm - American Araiz: And Boruto had to run from the village
26/01/2024, 10:20 pm - ali: oh thats why
26/01/2024, 10:20 pm - ali: i guess theyre trying to fit it all back into that opening shot
26/01/2024, 10:20 pm - ali: of boruto
26/01/2024, 10:20 pm - American Araiz: For some reason the only people who weren’t affected were the two girls who are in love with Boruto
26/01/2024, 10:20 pm - American Araiz: Sarada are surume
26/01/2024, 10:21 pm - ali: boruto has 2 bad bitches on him??

26/01/2024, 10:21 pm - American Araiz: Shikamaru about to become 8th hokage
26/01/2024, 10:21 pm - ali: makes sense i read about this
26/01/2024, 10:21 pm - ali: since naruto is 'missing'
26/01/2024, 10:21 pm - American Araiz: Kakashi and tsunade not seen in ages

26/01/2024, 10:22 pm - ali: the name boruto
26/01/2024, 10:22 pm - ali: is just non serious
26/01/2024, 10:22 pm - American Araiz: I think that’s not the only issue but I agree lol
26/01/2024, 10:23 pm - ali: naruto is such an infamous animanaga, that when one hears theres a sequel called boruto automatically it sounds like s parady
26/01/2024, 10:23 pm - American Araiz: And just like every side character from Naruto’s class was forgotten so has every side character from Borutos class
26/01/2024, 10:23 pm - American Araiz: Fr lol
26/01/2024, 10:23 pm - ali: like if dragon ball z had a sequel where main hero was like doku

31/01/2024, 8:06 pm - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
31/01/2024, 8:06 pm - ali: LMAOO
31/01/2024, 8:09 pm - American Araiz: Man all these fraud sorcerers need to step aside and let the true king take on Sukuna
31/01/2024, 8:09 pm - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
31/01/2024, 8:09 pm - ali: LMAOOO
31/01/2024, 8:09 pm - ali: buggy doin his kenjaku impression
31/01/2024, 8:37 pm - American Araiz: Was reminiscing and chainsaw man anime was so damn good
31/01/2024, 8:38 pm - ali: literally was reading old chapters
31/01/2024, 8:38 pm - American Araiz: Hope the direction and cinematography of the movie and second season will be that good too
31/01/2024, 8:38 pm - ali: <Media omitted>

31/01/2024, 8:39 pm - ali: atleast makima will be in it so ill be watching
31/01/2024, 8:40 pm - American Araiz: Part 1 goated but story ain’t even the main reason I loved the anime so much. The music, having different outros each ep, the vfx like the chainsaw was so good. The use of 3D etc
31/01/2024, 8:40 pm - American Araiz: Never seen an anime put that much focus on things like that
31/01/2024, 8:40 pm - American Araiz: Made it feel so much more unique
31/01/2024, 8:40 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
31/01/2024, 8:41 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
31/01/2024, 8:42 pm - American Araiz: When I go into a new anime I’m expecting a good story and characters as the bare minimum. Without that I won’t even continue a series. All the other miscellaneous stuff would make me fall in love with the series
31/01/2024, 8:42 pm - ali: would u watch a show with amazing story but terrible intro outros
31/01/2024, 8:42 pm - American Araiz: Yeah ofc
31/01/2024, 8:43 pm - American Araiz: Intro outro is not make or break for me but good ones add a lot to a show for me
31/01/2024, 8:43 pm - ali: would u watch a show, all 12 eps that has the best intro outro but boring snoozfest lazy story
31/01/2024, 8:43 pm - ali: is my point
31/01/2024, 8:43 pm - ali: yess i agree
31/01/2024, 8:43 pm - American Araiz: Hell no
31/01/2024, 8:43 pm - ali: they're icing on the top
31/01/2024, 8:43 pm - ali: story is always foundation for me
31/01/2024, 8:43 pm - American Araiz: I would just add the songs to my playlist
31/01/2024, 8:43 pm - ali: like good intor outro push an anime from a 7 to a 9 or a 10
31/01/2024, 8:44 pm - American Araiz: Yeah but see mashle for example. That opening has singlehandly convinced me to try that show
31/01/2024, 8:44 pm - ali: intro outro animation, any non story etuff
31/01/2024, 8:44 pm - ali: yea but if story is mid ur not gonna watch past ep 3
31/01/2024, 8:44 pm - American Araiz: Yeah agreed
31/01/2024, 8:44 pm - American Araiz: I think more anime need to be more creative the same way chainsaw man was
31/01/2024, 8:44 pm - ali: yess
31/01/2024, 8:45 pm - ali: mashle is literally jojo comedy meets One punch man
31/01/2024, 8:45 pm - ali: set in hogwarts
31/01/2024, 8:45 pm - American Araiz: Damn
31/01/2024, 8:45 pm - American Araiz: Unfortunately I’ve had to put shows on the back burner rn cause next 2/3 months will just be gaming for me
31/01/2024, 8:46 pm - ali: yea its not that urgent of a watch lmaoo
31/01/2024, 8:46 pm - ali: like its fun time with food

31/01/2024, 8:46 pm - American Araiz: Always my go to when I’m eating
31/01/2024, 8:48 pm - ali: fujimoto fans hating on jjk never makes sense tonme
31/01/2024, 8:48 pm - American Araiz: Those two series are two sides of the same coin
31/01/2024, 8:48 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
31/01/2024, 8:49 pm - American Araiz: U need to try some of the classics bro
31/01/2024, 8:49 pm - American Araiz: Like Hunter x Hunter
31/01/2024, 8:49 pm - American Araiz: These new gens cannot compare
31/01/2024, 8:50 pm - ali: who will give me the time for horrible pacing
31/01/2024, 8:50 pm - American Araiz: Boomer in me talking
31/01/2024, 8:50 pm - American Araiz: Hxh has amazing pacing
31/01/2024, 8:50 pm - ali: hxh forsure amazing but nothing in it intrigues me, like any clip or any character doesnt move me
31/01/2024, 8:50 pm - ali: not saying its bad so dont kill me
31/01/2024, 8:51 pm - American Araiz: Because it’s not ur twitter hype fest shounen like the new gens
31/01/2024, 8:51 pm - American Araiz: It’s just amazing story and characters
31/01/2024, 8:51 pm - American Araiz: And the godfather of anime power systems
31/01/2024, 8:51 pm - ali: what do u think would happen if twitter existed when hxh was airign?
31/01/2024, 8:51 pm - ali: ssme thing that happens to jjk etc 🤣
31/01/2024, 8:51 pm - ali: probs more since hxh started it
31/01/2024, 8:52 pm - American Araiz: Man I have a love hate relationship with that side of twitter
31/01/2024, 8:52 pm - ali: why do u hate
31/01/2024, 8:52 pm - American Araiz: Sometimes it’s funny but othertimes it’s really obnoxious and makes the series seem like a popcorn battle flick like the equivalent of marvel movies
31/01/2024, 8:53 pm - ali: yea , i guess i dont feel it cus literally every fandom thats popular gets that side
31/01/2024, 8:53 pm - ali: like marvel fans, footballs fans, any media
31/01/2024, 8:54 pm - American Araiz: Yeah I guess
31/01/2024, 8:54 pm - American Araiz: Idk
31/01/2024, 8:54 pm - American Araiz: Jjk is in a weird place for me considering the type of popularity it is rn. Like it’s not ur traditional kind of popular it’s social media popular
31/01/2024, 8:55 pm - ali: wdym
31/01/2024, 8:55 pm - ali: not traditionally popular?
31/01/2024, 8:55 pm - American Araiz: And probably the first anime to get that kind of social media popularity
31/01/2024, 8:55 pm - American Araiz: I can’t send vn rn and idk how to articulate this lol
31/01/2024, 8:56 pm - American Araiz: Jjk definitely is popular in the traditional sense as well but morseo in the social media culture way
31/01/2024, 8:56 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
31/01/2024, 8:57 pm - ali: sorry for vns
31/01/2024, 8:57 pm - American Araiz: Nah I can listen just not send
31/01/2024, 8:58 pm - ali: comparing jjk chapters weekly to csm is so interesting
31/01/2024, 8:58 pm - ali: like jjk worst chapters
31/01/2024, 8:58 pm - ali: and csm worst chapters
31/01/2024, 8:58 pm - ali: not the same
31/01/2024, 8:58 pm - ali: i dont think fujimoto cares for csm or something man
31/01/2024, 8:59 pm - American Araiz: I mean as for sports and movie people taking about it I think it’s just because anime is completely mainstream now. You’re more likely to find someone who watches anime than doesn’t
31/01/2024, 8:59 pm - American Araiz: They are pretty similar for me cause my bar is automatically too high cause of one piece
31/01/2024, 9:00 pm - American Araiz: For me the jjk bad chapters were worse then csm
31/01/2024, 9:00 pm - American Araiz: Csm chapters which made me drop it were like boring and I felt indifferent to the series at the point
31/01/2024, 9:00 pm - American Araiz: Jjk I was still invested but did not like some of the things gege was doing
31/01/2024, 9:04 pm - ali: yea but i can tell which anime are referenced more than others
31/01/2024, 9:04 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
31/01/2024, 9:06 pm - American Araiz: One piece Dbz Naruto 🔛🔝
31/01/2024, 9:08 pm - American Araiz: Agreed
31/01/2024, 9:08 pm - American Araiz: Jjk even though I disliked a lot of geges story decisions, I’m still invested in the story and want to know what happens next. For csm I lost interest and did not care what happened next which is worse
31/01/2024, 9:09 pm - American Araiz: Bro one piece is so popular in Europe
31/01/2024, 9:09 pm - American Araiz: Way more than anything else

31/01/2024, 9:10 pm - American Araiz: The only one even kinda remotely close in second is my hero which has also fallen off hard
31/01/2024, 9:10 pm - ali: yea that was pretty popular
31/01/2024, 9:11 pm - ali: demon slayer was getting traction

01/02/2024, 10:07 am - ali: i noticed this a couple of weeks ago
01/02/2024, 10:09 am - American Araiz: So kenjaku is dead
01/02/2024, 10:09 am - ali: feels so
01/02/2024, 10:09 am - ali: unless merger
01/02/2024, 10:09 am - ali: brings everyone back
01/02/2024, 10:09 am - ali: or does something
01/02/2024, 10:09 am - American Araiz: Give me tldr of what merger is I don’t remember
01/02/2024, 10:09 am - American Araiz: Are we talking everyone everyone
01/02/2024, 10:12 am - ali: kenjakus basic life plan was to  make everyone have cursed energy, and combine them with tengen(who manages all the cursed energy flow in japan). Like how tengen merges every 500 years with human(riko), this time kenjaku wants tengen to merge with everyone in japan. 

This is to see what would happen, literally out of curiosity but i think kenjaku believes this will create a new evolution of cursed spirit or new form of cursed energy
01/02/2024, 10:12 am - ali: i think that would be an unexpected side effect, i dont think main goal, cus kenjaku himself says he has no idea what would happen
01/02/2024, 10:13 am - ali: sukuna says he wants to fight whatever thr product of the merger is
01/02/2024, 10:13 am - American Araiz: This feels like infinite tsukuyomi from Naruto
01/02/2024, 10:13 am - American Araiz: Hmm interesting
01/02/2024, 10:13 am - American Araiz: Yeah it’s definitely happening
01/02/2024, 10:13 am - ali: yes but imo more interesting lmaoo
01/02/2024, 10:14 am - ali: infinite tsukuyomi was so cool until it took so long and didnt really do anything
01/02/2024, 10:14 am - American Araiz: I think this would be cool but I swear if gege pulls a kishimoto and asspulls a nee super villian like kaguya <This message was edited>
01/02/2024, 10:14 am - ali: since main 4 were saved by sasuke
01/02/2024, 10:14 am - ali: i think sukuna is his kaguya

06/03/2024, 10:49 am - American Araiz: Vs Austin?
06/03/2024, 10:49 am - American Araiz: In books it’s not 1v1?
06/03/2024, 10:50 am - ali: in book paul kinda cooks feyd cus he can see the future so feyds plan is to use poison as his best chance of somehow winning
06/03/2024, 10:50 am - ali: paul still kinda overwhelms him but is like a cm away from actually killing paul
06/03/2024, 10:50 am - ali: it is but not as even
06/03/2024, 10:50 am - American Araiz: Ngl I liked the pure 1v1 fight to death especially after the huge grand battles
06/03/2024, 10:50 am - ali: which is nice for movie cus more exciting
06/03/2024, 10:50 am - American Araiz: Especially with the no music
06/03/2024, 10:50 am - American Araiz: Just sound effects and grunts

06/03/2024, 10:53 am - American Araiz: I was waiting for him to use it tbh
06/03/2024, 10:53 am - American Araiz: Glad he didn’t
06/03/2024, 10:53 am - ali: in book he purposely doesnt cus if he uses the voice to win that would give the bene gesserit credit for the victory
06/03/2024, 10:54 am - ali: which i like, denis kinda did the perfect thing to cut some info down and sub plots cus otherwise movie audiences wont keep up
06/03/2024, 10:54 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>

06/03/2024, 10:58 am - ali: LMAOO
06/03/2024, 10:58 am - ali: paul u are damn lucky we never see the genocide
06/03/2024, 10:59 am - ali: aot cooks where they show all the ppl dying like the turkish kid erc
06/03/2024, 10:59 am - ali: etc

06/03/2024, 10:59 am - American Araiz: That scene was what made me go anti Eren
06/03/2024, 10:59 am - ali: they still do a good job cus they show eren reacting to see all the deaths
06/03/2024, 10:59 am - ali: and him breaking down
06/03/2024, 11:00 am - American Araiz: Yeah
06/03/2024, 11:02 am - ali: but the number difference of erens genocide and muadibs jihad is CRAZY

06/03/2024, 11:02 am - American Araiz: Eren was 80% of the world
06/03/2024, 11:02 am - ali: the jihad was 61 billion ppl LMAOO
06/03/2024, 11:02 am - American Araiz: 💀
06/03/2024, 11:02 am - ali: around 2 billion ppl
06/03/2024, 11:02 am - ali: if aot is set in 1900s
06/03/2024, 11:03 am - American Araiz: Yeah probably like 1940s type
06/03/2024, 11:03 am - American Araiz: I mean idk how bad of a light the dune books portray the outsiders as in comparison
06/03/2024, 11:04 am - American Araiz: Like in aot Marley and a few other major nation governments were extremists against the eldians
06/03/2024, 11:04 am - American Araiz: Not the majority of the world
06/03/2024, 11:04 am - ali: eren is not as similar to paul
06/03/2024, 11:04 am - ali: anakin from star wars is literally paul LMAO
06/03/2024, 11:04 am - ali: yess
06/03/2024, 11:04 am - American Araiz: Eren is more or less radical/extreme?
06/03/2024, 11:04 am - American Araiz: More I’m guessing
06/03/2024, 11:04 am - American Araiz: Can’t relate
06/03/2024, 11:05 am - ali: eren is moreso the product of systemic oppression, what centuries of blood war would result in a person becoming

Paul is basically what happens when religous factions try to control a group of ppl by making them believe in a singular person as a prophet,
06/03/2024, 11:06 am - ali: eren and paul are similar in terms theyre trying to find the best possible future

27/04/2024, 11:52 am - American Araiz: Idk how far it would cover in act1
27/04/2024, 11:53 am - American Araiz: But for me it was one of those games that took me like 10 hours to get used to it because I had never played such a mechanic heavy rpg like that before
27/04/2024, 11:53 am - American Araiz: But it’ll be similar to Diablo 4 for u I think
27/04/2024, 11:53 am - American Araiz: Also download the FF16 demo and try that sometime it’s unreal
27/04/2024, 12:03 pm - ali: its 2 hour time trial
27/04/2024, 12:03 pm - American Araiz: Ohhh so it automatically ends after two hours?
27/04/2024, 12:03 pm - American Araiz: Even if ur like afk for those two hours

27/04/2024, 12:26 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
27/04/2024, 12:33 pm - American Araiz: I would not recommend playing origin characters
27/04/2024, 12:33 pm - American Araiz: First playthroughs highly recommended to be custom characters
27/04/2024, 12:36 pm - ali: really
27/04/2024, 12:36 pm - ali: oki this is for tutorial only
27/04/2024, 12:36 pm - ali: 2 hours i wanna get into gameplay

27/04/2024, 12:36 pm - ali: even tho my brother is already convicned to buy cus he hates time trial

27/04/2024, 12:38 pm - American Araiz: Gameplay took me a long time to get the hang off but probably because I had never played a game like this before
27/04/2024, 12:38 pm - American Araiz: You’ve played mmorpgs and computer rpg type games
27/04/2024, 12:46 pm - ali: yess

27/04/2024, 12:46 pm - ali: split screen is different lowkey basicslly both me and my co op have to take their  turn
27/04/2024, 12:46 pm - American Araiz: The greatest thing about this game is how much impact every single dialogue choice and action makes
27/04/2024, 12:46 pm - ali: not enough movement means at some point we can do 2 moves at once?

17/05/2024, 11:57 am - American Araiz: I don’t think any volume reached the amount of sales that the gojo vs Sukuna volume did

17/05/2024, 12:03 pm - American Araiz: I have one small nitpick with the jjk chapters
17/05/2024, 12:03 pm - American Araiz: I don’t like when chapters are named part 1,2,3 so on
17/05/2024, 12:03 pm - American Araiz: I wish each chapter had its own unique title
17/05/2024, 12:04 pm - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
17/05/2024, 12:04 pm - ali: i never even read chapter names
17/05/2024, 12:04 pm - ali: i read volume names
17/05/2024, 12:04 pm - American Araiz: That’s the first thing I always look at
17/05/2024, 12:04 pm - American Araiz: Volumes don’t have names???
17/05/2024, 12:05 pm - American Araiz: Just numbers
17/05/2024, 12:05 pm - ali: they have names
17/05/2024, 12:05 pm - ali: 26 is named heading south
17/05/2024, 12:05 pm - ali: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jujutsu_Kaisen_chapters
17/05/2024, 12:06 pm - American Araiz: Oh yeah ur right
17/05/2024, 12:06 pm - American Araiz: I’ve never known lol
17/05/2024, 12:06 pm - American Araiz: I always look at chap names not volumes
17/05/2024, 12:07 pm - American Araiz: Cause I never read whole volumes just chapter by chalter
17/05/2024, 12:13 pm - ali: idk who reads volumes as like first time reading
17/05/2024, 12:14 pm - ali: cus they come out so late and with social media its hard to avoid
17/05/2024, 12:14 pm - ali: aot only one ive read multiple volumes of
18/05/2024, 10:05 am - American Araiz: Just finished Vinland saga S2
18/05/2024, 10:05 am - American Araiz: I finally understand why this series is so acclaimed and beloved
18/05/2024, 10:06 am - American Araiz: The storytelling and character development is unbelievable
18/05/2024, 10:07 am - American Araiz: You gotta try this anime out it’s unreal. I would place it so far on the same tier as attack on titan. It’s one of those anime that doesn’t feel like an anime and feels like western book or show. No traditional anime tropes
18/05/2024, 10:07 am - American Araiz: Now onto the manga I need to see what happens next
18/05/2024, 10:08 am - American Araiz: And the craziest thing in common is that for both series the first season was made by WIT studio and then picked up by Mappa
18/05/2024, 3:48 pm - American Araiz: Just stayed up till 6 am reading all the manga
18/05/2024, 3:48 pm - American Araiz: Yeah I’m obsessed
18/05/2024, 3:49 pm - American Araiz: Now to wait for more chapters
18/05/2024, 4:11 pm - ali: yesssirrr
19/05/2024, 9:12 am - American Araiz: Fortnite?
19/05/2024, 9:13 am - ali: on

19/05/2024, 9:13 am - American Araiz: Okie
21/05/2024, 9:27 pm - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
21/05/2024, 9:46 pm - ali: 😭😭
21/05/2024, 10:00 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
22/05/2024, 1:35 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
22/05/2024, 1:35 am - American Araiz: What is going on in part 2 man
22/05/2024, 1:36 am - ali: i am really enjoying it now lowkeyy hahaa
22/05/2024, 1:36 am - American Araiz: Any end of part 2 in sight
22/05/2024, 1:36 am - American Araiz: Wanna wait till it’s done to read it
22/05/2024, 1:37 am - ali: not really, i think end of part 2 is just end of cam
22/05/2024, 1:37 am - ali: csm in general
22/05/2024, 2:21 am - American Araiz: How long do u think left tho
22/05/2024, 2:21 am - American Araiz: Whens my goat power coming back
22/05/2024, 2:22 am - ali: i think 2 more years?
22/05/2024, 2:22 am - ali: frrr i forgot bout her
22/05/2024, 2:22 am - ali: kishibe too
22/05/2024, 2:22 am - American Araiz: U a fake one
22/05/2024, 2:22 am - American Araiz: Wo miss hai
22/05/2024, 9:45 am - ali: venture got a buff
22/05/2024, 9:46 am - ali: we back
22/05/2024, 9:47 am - American Araiz: U eating good
24/05/2024, 12:11 pm - ali: https://tcb-backup.bihar-mirchi.com/chapters/7738/jujutsu-kaisen-chapter-261?date=24-5-2024-12
24/05/2024, 5:02 pm - American Araiz: Reading the actual translated chapter instead of posts on twitter definitely made me like it a bit more
24/05/2024, 5:02 pm - ali: sameee
24/05/2024, 5:02 pm - American Araiz: If sukuna somehow still doesn’t lose bro
24/05/2024, 5:02 pm - ali: i went back and re read some old chapters especially during gojo sukuna and its soo clear they were hinting at this
24/05/2024, 5:03 pm - American Araiz: There is no stronger entity that can come after this
24/05/2024, 5:03 pm - ali: FR
24/05/2024, 5:03 pm - ali: i love it man he really is the strongest
24/05/2024, 5:03 pm - American Araiz: How does that mf still have energy for a domain expansion
24/05/2024, 5:03 pm - ali: like he had a lot of build up but i feel satisfied with how far sukuna has gotten
24/05/2024, 5:03 pm - American Araiz: I still don’t like that yuji and todo got sidelined so fast
24/05/2024, 5:04 pm - ali: i agree the timing a bit weird but i wanna wait for next chapter to see how it plays out
24/05/2024, 5:04 pm - ali: but i think writing wise this was such a BOLD move to pull off well
24/05/2024, 5:04 pm - ali: and i love it
24/05/2024, 5:04 pm - ali: especially for yutas character
24/05/2024, 5:04 pm - ali: rip yuta maki tho
24/05/2024, 5:05 pm - ali: makes gojos character even more tragic
24/05/2024, 5:05 pm - American Araiz: I would’ve liked at least one chapter where Sukuna fought and tried to adapt to the absurd teleporting
24/05/2024, 5:06 pm - American Araiz: Yeah it did make his character way more complex
24/05/2024, 5:06 pm - American Araiz: I’m still a bit on the fence though I’m gonna see how this plays out in the next few chapters first
24/05/2024, 5:07 pm - ali: i firmly believe when this arc gets animated this would be muchhh better than shibuyra
24/05/2024, 5:07 pm - American Araiz: Action wise yes, writing wise I don’t think so
24/05/2024, 5:07 pm - American Araiz: That first yuji breakdown was just so impactful for me
24/05/2024, 5:07 pm - ali: yesss same, im very interested to see where gege goes with this but obviously can fumble it but i think all bold and interesting writing choices have a fear of suffering from that
24/05/2024, 5:08 pm - American Araiz: The introduction of mahoraga and toji too
24/05/2024, 5:08 pm - ali: samee i think seeing gojos flashbacks of them planning and him accepting his body being used and thinking of geto only will hit
24/05/2024, 5:08 pm - ali: yujis 6 black flashes i will be there
25/05/2024, 12:37 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
25/05/2024, 1:18 am - ali: yuji fought him in culling games right before sukuna took over megumi
25/05/2024, 6:00 am - ali: any clue if a uk credit cards would work as payment for my usa ps account?
25/05/2024, 6:01 am - American Araiz: No idea u would have to add the card info and see if it registers
25/05/2024, 6:01 am - American Araiz: U need the card info and billing address to add the payment method
25/05/2024, 6:01 am - ali: <Media omitted>
25/05/2024, 6:02 am - American Araiz: I don’t remember this lmao
25/05/2024, 6:02 am - American Araiz: I may be one of 10 ppl but man I love black clover
25/05/2024, 6:02 am - American Araiz: It’s very generic shounen and tropes but it’s unapologetic and delivers it in a great way
25/05/2024, 6:02 am - ali: i thought it ended
25/05/2024, 6:03 am - ali: didnt know still goin
25/05/2024, 6:03 am - American Araiz: Very close to ending
25/05/2024, 6:03 am - American Araiz: But it got taken out of shounen jump
25/05/2024, 6:03 am - American Araiz: Because authors health got really bad
25/05/2024, 6:03 am - American Araiz: He couldn’t do weekly anymore
25/05/2024, 6:03 am - ali: oh shit
25/05/2024, 6:03 am - American Araiz: Now there’s a chapter every 3 months lol
25/05/2024, 6:03 am - American Araiz: Longer chapters but still
25/05/2024, 6:03 am - ali: undead unluck author also on deathbed  recently
25/05/2024, 6:04 am - American Araiz: Hunter x Hunter too
25/05/2024, 6:04 am - American Araiz: But he has been for a decade
25/05/2024, 6:04 am - ali: i think thas old news
25/05/2024, 6:04 am - ali: idk weekly manga chapters as a model is not sustainable
25/05/2024, 6:04 am - American Araiz: It’s not
25/05/2024, 6:04 am - ali: for health, writing, artwork
25/05/2024, 6:04 am - American Araiz: I’m all for changing it to biweekly
25/05/2024, 6:04 am - ali: yeee
25/05/2024, 6:05 am - ali: jojo i enjoy now lowkey
25/05/2024, 6:05 am - American Araiz: Even monthly if authors wants it to
25/05/2024, 6:05 am - ali: every month i get my 40 page jojoland
25/05/2024, 6:05 am - American Araiz: Like Vinland saga is monthly and I don’t mind
25/05/2024, 6:05 am - American Araiz: Peak
25/05/2024, 6:05 am - American Araiz: Still waiting for the damn part 7 anime
25/05/2024, 6:05 am - ali: aot also was monthly?
25/05/2024, 6:05 am - American Araiz: Yup
25/05/2024, 6:05 am - ali: has to be shit had 139 chapters
25/05/2024, 7:25 am - American Araiz: Gonna point out one more complain I’ve been having this jjk lately
25/05/2024, 7:26 am - American Araiz: There have been too many mid fight flashbacks this arc that provide exposition for what’s happening in the present
25/05/2024, 7:26 am - American Araiz: What happened to show not tell. It feels like whenever there’s a new power up/ability/ new character enters a fight there’s a flashback explaining why it’s happening
25/05/2024, 12:59 pm - ali: but that is show? not tell?
tell would be just rhe narrator explaining everything they did and what their plan was
25/05/2024, 1:00 pm - ali: i like the flashbacks cus we see the team interacting and how they argue or come to a point
25/05/2024, 1:00 pm - ali: im so much more happier this was a time skip rather than linear story telling
25/05/2024, 1:02 pm - American Araiz: I disagree. I would much rather there be some of these conversations occur and there be a plan before the fight began instead of showing none or little of the planning phase and going straight into the fight. This way gege could literally write anything into the fight and insert a flashback to provide an explanation for it
25/05/2024, 1:03 pm - ali: but then  it wouldnt be a twist?
25/05/2024, 1:03 pm - American Araiz: Makes it feel like it’s he’s just going with the flow and doesn’t know where the fight will go which is why the direction the story is going in seems messy
25/05/2024, 1:03 pm - ali: like if we knew their plans then we would know too much of the fight
25/05/2024, 1:03 pm - American Araiz: I’m not saying everything has to be planned
25/05/2024, 1:03 pm - American Araiz: But have some sort of plan and if things go south then twists would be more impactful
25/05/2024, 1:04 pm - ali: theoretically yes but so far nothing hes done has been like cat out of the hat bs except for todo somehow coming back
25/05/2024, 1:04 pm - American Araiz: Personally, flashbacks are far more impactful when they aren’t action or fight focused. Flashbacks add the most when the add to the lore and worldbuilding
25/05/2024, 1:05 pm - American Araiz: Naruto is a great example of that
25/05/2024, 1:05 pm - ali: flashbacks happen alot for character development and motivaiton reveal?
25/05/2024, 1:05 pm - ali: literally snape from harry potter
25/05/2024, 1:06 pm - American Araiz: Yeah but there was only one example of this in this chapter for me. Those 2 pages of yuta talking about him becoming a monster and gojos suffering was an example of something that feels impactful as a flashback
25/05/2024, 1:07 pm - ali: also i think this was the only chapter where most of it was a flashback
25/05/2024, 1:07 pm - ali: previously i think at best 1 or 2 pages were
25/05/2024, 1:11 pm - American Araiz: Whereas the rest of the chapter which was also mostly flashback is just providing exposition for events that have already happened. I personally don’t like this kind of writing it feels weird to be for battles exclusively in manga
25/05/2024, 1:11 pm - American Araiz: If you go back and read the last 20 chapters I can guarantee you probably 80% of them have had flashbacks
25/05/2024, 1:12 pm - American Araiz: This many flashbacks in fights is way too excessive and feels like him retconning things
25/05/2024, 1:13 pm - ali: 80% is defo stretching it cus of the top of my head i can only remember flashack of sukuna and uruame discussing yujis heritage, i dont think any while higuruma was fighting sukuna, none during gojo sukuna, or when miguel joined with getos crew
25/05/2024, 1:14 pm - ali: how is it retconning, hes not changing any characters ability that hw didnt foreshadow? or add any random character move EXCEPT for todo ka doo hickey?
25/05/2024, 1:14 pm - American Araiz: I’m so confident 80% is minimum. Even since gojo died almost every single chapter has had some form of flashback
25/05/2024, 1:14 pm - ali: ill check honestly w8
25/05/2024, 1:14 pm - American Araiz: I’m checking too

258 had  4
257 had 2

25/05/2024, 1:20 pm - ali: 255 had 3 ish
25/05/2024, 1:21 pm - ali: 254 had 1
25/05/2024, 1:21 pm - ali: im doing last 10 chapters till 250
25/05/2024, 1:21 pm - ali: 253 had 1
25/05/2024, 1:22 pm - American Araiz: Not in 237
Not really in 238
Not in 239 (kenjaku fight starts)
Big one in 240
Big one in 241

Not in 248
A few in 249
Not in 250
Several pages in 251

A few in 253
25/05/2024, 1:22 pm - American Araiz: Ok I think we met in the middle
25/05/2024, 1:22 pm - American Araiz: So roughly half the chapters have had some form of flashback
25/05/2024, 1:23 pm - ali: WAIT
25/05/2024, 1:23 pm - ali: bro
25/05/2024, 1:23 pm - ali: 251 has like 2 pages at best?
25/05/2024, 1:23 pm - ali: what
25/05/2024, 1:23 pm - ali: its 90% yuta using jscobs ladder and other copy moves
25/05/2024, 1:24 pm - American Araiz: Ok yea u right my bad
25/05/2024, 1:24 pm - ali: i think  its evenly spaced out enough, i hateee exposition and iss tarhan key stuff but i dont think it has hindererd the amazing fights thas been consistently happening sonce 225
25/05/2024, 1:25 pm - American Araiz: But still u get my point. There are too many explanation flashbacks for fights. I do not have a problem with flashbacks my issue is them being for fights and action scenes
25/05/2024, 1:25 pm - American Araiz: Like I’m trying to imagine how this will be handled in anime
25/05/2024, 1:25 pm - American Araiz: And how to make it feel seamless
25/05/2024, 1:25 pm - American Araiz: Without not feeling choppy and interrupted <This message was edited>
25/05/2024, 1:25 pm - ali: its not happening in the middle of a fight, manga is different cus theres a "break" in readers mind in between chapters
25/05/2024, 1:26 pm - American Araiz: You can say the same for in between episodes in an anime
25/05/2024, 1:26 pm - ali: so he adds like 2 panels in the beginning, i think they;; just shift them around in anime or just in between the fights. mappa ik will extend some of these fights and add more
25/05/2024, 1:26 pm - American Araiz: Yuji vs mahito was multiple episodes
25/05/2024, 1:26 pm - ali: yaa
25/05/2024, 1:26 pm - ali: like sukuna mahoraga is just like 1 chapter
25/05/2024, 1:26 pm - ali: and they made an entire episode out of it loll
25/05/2024, 1:27 pm - American Araiz: Manga chapters and anime episodes need to work no matter if they were consumed weekly or binged
25/05/2024, 1:27 pm - American Araiz: Like this arc may be way more enjoyable as a binge
25/05/2024, 1:27 pm - ali: yea and i think these work even if u binge, ur getting on average 12 pages of fights and then 3-4 panels of flashbacks and then back to fights
25/05/2024, 1:27 pm - ali: yesss but weekly twists has my heart pumpinggg
25/05/2024, 1:28 pm - American Araiz: Man idk
25/05/2024, 1:28 pm - ali: 260 final panel being gojos eyes is soo good, its like how shows end some eps on a cliffhanger that may not go anwywhere long term but its perfect for that episode
25/05/2024, 1:28 pm - ali: but i think weekly chapter =/ weekly episodes
25/05/2024, 1:29 pm - American Araiz: I’m glad ur enjoying but I feel like anime is where im gonna enjoy jjk to these levels again. Manga is not connecting with me like that
25/05/2024, 1:29 pm - American Araiz: Agreed
25/05/2024, 1:29 pm - ali: yea thas completely fairr
25/05/2024, 1:29 pm - American Araiz: I wouldn’t disagree that jjk manga has had some really good moments these last 20-30 chapters
25/05/2024, 1:29 pm - American Araiz: Mostly being Yuta and yuji moments for me
25/05/2024, 1:29 pm - ali: even the fights i enjoy and gege is doin his best to make it visible but imo ive read now 4-6 mangas now and not a single time i have enjoyed fights more in manga than anime
25/05/2024, 1:30 pm - ali: like ik when this gets animated the manga would propbably have ended
25/05/2024, 1:30 pm - ali: so we'll view theses fights veryyy differently
25/05/2024, 1:30 pm - ali: knwoing the full context you know?
25/05/2024, 1:31 pm - American Araiz: But overall it doesn’t feel coherent and just feels like gege is winging it sometimes and does not know where the fight or story is going exactly. I’m really curious to see how this series will end cause I don’t think I’ve ever consumed a series that will be as difficult to nail the ending as jjk will be. I think gege has written himself into a corner
25/05/2024, 1:31 pm - ali: like now if someone started the anime , they woulnt feel as emotional about todo losing a hand cus he does comeback
25/05/2024, 1:31 pm - American Araiz: Only like 2/3 I’ve enjoyed more in manga
25/05/2024, 1:31 pm - American Araiz: But yes 90% times anime better
25/05/2024, 1:31 pm - American Araiz: Same
25/05/2024, 1:32 pm - American Araiz: I highkey sometimes wish I remained anime only but jjk community is too wild to avoid spoilers
25/05/2024, 1:32 pm - ali: I think maybe part of the incohrerenct even id use a different word is to show how much sukunas strength has forced these ppl to literally try everyhting they can and think of anything and anyone to help. If this is the true sukuna final boss etc
25/05/2024, 1:33 pm - American Araiz: Jjk community reaching such high levels of popularity that even the small toxic minority has become so large lol
25/05/2024, 1:33 pm - ali: factss my brother messaged me 3 days ago "Gojo?" and he is not even CLOSE to any anime community
25/05/2024, 1:33 pm - ali: Fact
25/05/2024, 1:33 pm - American Araiz: 😭😭
25/05/2024, 1:33 pm - ali: ik alot of ppl are memeing
25/05/2024, 1:34 pm - American Araiz: Right but this direction i would kind of like if the villain somehow ends on top in the end. It would be a controversial ending but it would be a ballsy one
25/05/2024, 1:34 pm - American Araiz: Hell when the aot ending came out it was controversial and people hated it
25/05/2024, 1:35 pm - American Araiz: Took months even years for people to kind of accept it and like it
25/05/2024, 1:35 pm - ali: thas still different cus in context the " the good guys" prevailed
25/05/2024, 1:35 pm - ali: ur ending would be eren compeltelting the rumbling
25/05/2024, 1:35 pm - American Araiz: No lol I wasn’t team Eren
25/05/2024, 1:36 pm - American Araiz: Eren had been too far gone for a while I don’t understand the side of the community that are Eren sympathizers
25/05/2024, 1:37 pm - ali: no i mean u ssid the villian wins in the end
25/05/2024, 1:37 pm - ali: that would be a ballsy ending
25/05/2024, 1:37 pm - ali: bad imo
25/05/2024, 1:37 pm - American Araiz: My complaint was that the final arc in aot was quite rushed and there were a lot of unnecessary things that happened and some necessary things that didn’t happen. Similar things happening in jjk for me rn
25/05/2024, 1:37 pm - American Araiz: I would not like this for aot but wouldn’t mind it for jjk. Personal preference I guess
25/05/2024, 1:37 pm - ali: idk a villian winnign hasn't happened snd i think yuji has been set up to be the one to prevail to sukunas bloodshed and strength
25/05/2024, 1:38 pm - American Araiz: I think it’s probably because I value the story and worldbuilding of aot far more than jjk
25/05/2024, 1:38 pm - ali: i guess id see how gege does it,
25/05/2024, 1:38 pm - ali: yea but also different storys, aots world building is buily into the story and something the characters themselves are doin with hus
25/05/2024, 1:39 pm - American Araiz: The first 90% of the aot story is so magnificently perfect that by those standards the ending was a bit rushed and not as strong
25/05/2024, 1:39 pm - ali: jjk has always been about struggle of jujtusu society and how its constructed
25/05/2024, 1:40 pm - American Araiz: This is a discussion we’ve had before lol cause we enjoy this series for different things. The story has  never been a strong suit for me it was always the side characters and fights
25/05/2024, 1:40 pm - American Araiz: I’ve watched and read several other series that have a very similar premise to jjk
25/05/2024, 1:42 pm - American Araiz: Jjk story and setting is a combination of 
Naruto
Blue exorcist
Soul eater 
Demon slayer
Noragami
25/05/2024, 1:43 pm - American Araiz: All these series have done the exact same things jjk is doing. I can confidently say that the only reason jjk got this popular is because it was done with a modern take with modern characters/humor plus a phenomenal anime adaption that exponentially elevates the manga <This message was edited>
25/05/2024, 1:56 pm - ali: i agree aswell but also i think jjks deeper themes and character writing gets underrated ALOT by geges good fighting choreography
25/05/2024, 1:56 pm - ali: jjk does break alot of anime shonen stereotypes aswell
25/05/2024, 1:59 pm - ali: like dbz for example, controversial take but dbz bachpan sey i enjoyed alot purely cus cool fights and cool transformations
25/05/2024, 1:59 pm - ali: and villians who had cool designs
25/05/2024, 2:00 pm - ali: story wise and world building usme bhi its okay imo
25/05/2024, 2:00 pm - ali: but its still 10/10 cus. its a unique to itself. worldbuilding  and lore drop is an amazing thing to want but not every media should have it or NEEDS it to be really really good
25/05/2024, 2:01 pm - ali: some plaves where its needed for story, some where it elevates the story and some places where its a good cherry on top
25/05/2024, 6:42 pm - American Araiz: Those themes and writing is there but it’s not that deep or comparable with other stories in the medium
25/05/2024, 6:42 pm - American Araiz: I wouldn’t say Dbz is a 10/10 lol
25/05/2024, 6:42 pm - American Araiz: It’s the godfather of the industry yeah
25/05/2024, 6:42 pm - American Araiz: Everything other series do now originated from dbz
25/05/2024, 6:42 pm - ali: i mean yea im not comapring it to other manga thas the point
25/05/2024, 6:43 pm - American Araiz: But they have also done everything better
25/05/2024, 6:44 pm - American Araiz: Wish I could relate I compare everything lol
25/05/2024, 6:44 pm - ali: also fornite new season is crazyyyyy
25/05/2024, 6:44 pm - American Araiz: Yeah looks interesting
25/05/2024, 6:44 pm - ali: i really like the new weapons they introduced
25/05/2024, 6:44 pm - ali: its literally doomfist
25/05/2024, 6:44 pm - American Araiz: Haven’t tried yet
25/05/2024, 6:44 pm - ali: also mangeto  battle pass
25/05/2024, 6:44 pm - American Araiz: Already got the pass lil bro
25/05/2024, 6:45 pm - ali: sheesh king respect
25/05/2024, 6:47 pm - American Araiz: Also I big disagree on this. For me worldbuilding and lore will always add more to a series and show that an author puts in that extra effort in their series. I wanna be immersed in a story
25/05/2024, 6:47 pm - American Araiz: I would say let’s play but England vs pak match rn
25/05/2024, 6:49 pm - ali: thas good but asking every thing u watch to have that is wrong no?
25/05/2024, 6:49 pm - ali: some stories have differnet styles and purposes
25/05/2024, 6:50 pm - ali: like death note main world building tou nahi chahoye
25/05/2024, 6:50 pm - ali: jjk main finding more about africa key sorceres doesnt do much to main plot off yuji sukuna sorcerers i mean
25/05/2024, 6:51 pm - American Araiz: Yes agreed. I don’t want in in comedy or light hearted series. But I want it in fantasy and action/adventure series. Like one of my fav series of the year has been delicious in dungeon and I don’t need and worldbuilding or lore in that series
25/05/2024, 6:51 pm - ali: yeeee
25/05/2024, 6:51 pm - American Araiz: Not really. The most it could give it did regarding the shinigami. It had nothing else to explore
25/05/2024, 6:52 pm - American Araiz: Whereas jjk does
25/05/2024, 6:52 pm - American Araiz: Give me Heien era flashback man
25/05/2024, 6:53 pm - American Araiz: Also I said this before as well but I don’t like the fact that gege made a rule and that curses primarily pop up only in Japan
25/05/2024, 6:53 pm - ali: i think thas just something writers do to make their story more condensed
25/05/2024, 6:53 pm - American Araiz: Yet there are a few random cursed and random sorcerers in different countries for some reason
25/05/2024, 6:53 pm - American Araiz: Then Miguel should not have existed
25/05/2024, 6:53 pm - ali: ?
25/05/2024, 6:54 pm - ali: he literally said cursed energy is most prevelant in japan
25/05/2024, 6:54 pm - ali: how is that a bad thing
25/05/2024, 6:54 pm - American Araiz: But why
25/05/2024, 6:54 pm - American Araiz: The reason curses are formed in negativity and hate. Why is that exclusive to Japan lol
25/05/2024, 6:56 pm - American Araiz: I would have not complained about this if he didn’t for some reason introduce a foreign sorcerer who was barely explored. Like that means cursed and sorcerers do exist outside of Japan to a fair extent. Why would readers not be interested in seeing that
25/05/2024, 6:57 pm - ali: araiz
25/05/2024, 6:57 pm - ali: if gege wrote an arc bout yutas journey in africa u would then say this arc is bad writing who gives a shit bout this filler
25/05/2024, 6:57 pm - American Araiz: Absolutely not why are u assuming this lol
25/05/2024, 6:57 pm - ali: if u liked lore builidg u would have loved culling games then? that literally had every big sorcerer in history
25/05/2024, 6:58 pm - American Araiz: Yea I definitely enjoyed culling games. Some of the characters introduced in that arc were really sick
25/05/2024, 6:58 pm - American Araiz: Like the two sorcerers Yuta fought i loved those guys
25/05/2024, 6:58 pm - ali: like fujimoto just gave us 1 arc of international assasings
25/05/2024, 6:59 pm - ali: i could complain why all the 4 horseoman of war are all in japan
25/05/2024, 6:59 pm - ali: and near denji
25/05/2024, 6:59 pm - ali: why coincidently they all just showed up in japan, why chainsaw devil was in japan when he got injuted and met denji?
25/05/2024, 7:00 pm - ali: like i get what ur saying but writers just do this creative fre
25/05/2024, 7:00 pm - ali: unless the entire world is fictional like naruto or one piece
25/05/2024, 7:00 pm - American Araiz: But I never found this to be in issue in csm because the origin and diversity of devils felt far more explored and then that of curses in jjk
25/05/2024, 7:00 pm - ali: is it? its literally almost same
25/05/2024, 7:00 pm - ali: devils just come from ppls fear
25/05/2024, 7:00 pm - ali: nothing more from that
25/05/2024, 7:01 pm - American Araiz: Yes but devils are far more established as individual unique beings. Curses are not
25/05/2024, 7:01 pm - ali: jjk goes more into how different curesed spirits work, RCT, domain expansiona and cursed energy is manipulated. csm focuses more on how devils are used with contracts
25/05/2024, 7:01 pm - American Araiz: Maybe I just like csms power system more then I guess
25/05/2024, 7:01 pm - ali: haan thas fair
25/05/2024, 7:02 pm - ali: one thing i wish fujimoto explains is why chainsaw of all devils is the most feared amongst other devils lmaoo
25/05/2024, 7:02 pm - ali: like he just wrote in oh yea every devil that pochita eats gets erased
25/05/2024, 7:03 pm - ali: i dont mind but im curiosu as to why besides just plot reasons to make denji important
25/05/2024, 7:03 pm - American Araiz: Jjk is a bit too over complicated sometimes in terms of power system. Lots of mechanics that get a bit hard to keep track of
25/05/2024, 7:04 pm - American Araiz: I agree
25/05/2024, 7:04 pm - American Araiz: I think Satan being the most powerful entity should’ve been a given
25/05/2024, 7:04 pm - ali: yeee i hope he comes
25/05/2024, 7:05 pm - American Araiz: Was the hell devil technically not Satan
25/05/2024, 7:06 pm - American Araiz: Yeah I agree
25/05/2024, 7:07 pm - ali: i think
25/05/2024, 7:07 pm - ali: but he had a contracy with santa claus
25/05/2024, 7:07 pm - ali: idk why satan would do that
25/05/2024, 7:10 pm - American Araiz: No clue
25/05/2024, 7:15 pm - American Araiz: Pls tell me there’s more kobeni in part 2
25/05/2024, 7:15 pm - American Araiz: She’s my favorite character
25/05/2024, 7:15 pm - ali: i do prefer jjk ki fights more than csm
25/05/2024, 7:15 pm - American Araiz: Yeah same by far
25/05/2024, 7:15 pm - ali: moreso cus csm fights are just chainsaw man just out eating someone
25/05/2024, 7:15 pm - ali: man i wish
25/05/2024, 7:15 pm - ali: kobeni kishibe not seen since
25/05/2024, 7:15 pm - ali: katana man is here
25/05/2024, 7:15 pm - ali: but hes in every single arc man
25/05/2024, 7:15 pm - American Araiz: Jjk has better fights and side characters. Csm has a better overall story for me
25/05/2024, 7:16 pm - American Araiz: Maaan
25/05/2024, 7:16 pm - ali: if part 1 was end of csm ahah
25/05/2024, 7:16 pm - American Araiz: Fujimoto what are u doing bruh bring em back
25/05/2024, 7:16 pm - American Araiz: Power too
25/05/2024, 7:16 pm - American Araiz: 10/10
25/05/2024, 7:16 pm - ali: part 2 still the story
25/05/2024, 7:16 pm - ali: soo not overall story technically
25/05/2024, 7:16 pm - ali: tbh i like this more
25/05/2024, 7:16 pm - ali: this is more focused on denji ka psyche
25/05/2024, 7:17 pm - ali: and him dealing with public perception of chainsaw man and finally having to think what he truly wants
25/05/2024, 7:17 pm - ali: like his real growth happens in part 2
25/05/2024, 7:17 pm - ali: imo
25/05/2024, 7:17 pm - American Araiz: I guess. I can’t say until I eventually read part 2
25/05/2024, 7:19 pm - American Araiz: World building in blue lock: child grows up on streets of Germany homeless and abused and kills 7 people with a soccer ball and ends up the star player of Bayern Munich
25/05/2024, 7:19 pm - ali: cryingngg
25/05/2024, 7:19 pm - ali: blue lock such a funny concept
25/05/2024, 7:19 pm - ali: i guess sports manga itself such a funny concept to mr

25/05/2024, 7:21 pm - American Araiz: They capture intensity and emotion and have u on the edge of ur seat way more then any action or battle series has ever done for me
25/05/2024, 7:22 pm - ali: frrr sports are crazyyy
25/05/2024, 7:23 pm - American Araiz: Ur ass would love blue lock idk what ur waiting for

25/05/2024, 7:37 pm - American Araiz: Probably same
26/05/2024, 11:02 pm - American Araiz: What the actual fuck are Hakari and Uraume doing? Yuta killed Kenjaku, arrived at Shinjuku, got cut in half, lobotomized and arrived back at Shinjuku as a corpse puppet and these clowns are still going at it.
26/05/2024, 11:21 pm - ali: lmaoo facts

30/05/2024, 8:14 am - American Araiz: <Media omitted>
30/05/2024, 8:14 am - American Araiz: Played this game for an hour
30/05/2024, 8:14 am - American Araiz: Ngl the gameplay is kinda ass
30/05/2024, 8:14 am - American Araiz: It feels just like the previous smash game which came out in like 2013
30/05/2024, 8:14 am - American Araiz: Gameplay and movement is too slow
30/05/2024, 8:41 am - ali: lmaooo yess
30/05/2024, 8:41 am - ali: its interestign
30/05/2024, 8:41 am - ali: ill still enjoy it cus free and online and 2v2 but  yea
30/05/2024, 8:41 am - American Araiz: Idk if this make senses but it feels like ur playing on moon gravity
30/05/2024, 8:41 am - ali: LMAOO
30/05/2024, 8:42 am - American Araiz: Smash ultimate has spoiled me man I need a new smash game next year with the new Nintendo console
30/05/2024, 8:42 am - American Araiz: The character diversity is awesome
30/05/2024, 8:42 am - American Araiz: I think their movesets and controls are good too
30/05/2024, 8:42 am - ali: switch 2 soon
30/05/2024, 8:43 am - American Araiz: I have 3 main complains tho
Gameplay feels too slow and like I said moon gravity type
The UI and main menu is absolute garbage 
The monetization seems very greedy. Unlocking all characters seems impossible
30/05/2024, 8:44 am - American Araiz: Pls don’t be a gimmicky console and have modern hardware
30/05/2024, 8:44 am - ali: ysa i hope they improve
30/05/2024, 8:44 am - ali: since this is the first release since beta 1 year ago
30/05/2024, 8:44 am - American Araiz: I hope so too
30/05/2024, 8:45 am - ali: ppl online have been enjoying it alot lmaoo
30/05/2024, 8:45 am - ali: so i hope a positive response helps them
30/05/2024, 8:45 am - ali: bro i was watching ninjas stream of fortnite and the poor guy is losing his. mind this season
30/05/2024, 8:45 am - ali: he has the most cartoonish death
30/05/2024, 8:46 am - American Araiz: Really lol. I’ve been seeing mostly critical opinions because my twitter is all smash players. Not all negative by any means but equal positives and negatives
30/05/2024, 8:46 am - American Araiz: There’s definitely the makings of a good game
30/05/2024, 8:46 am - ali: i saw him 1v1 a guy with guns and a car just rams into him from the left and dies instantly
30/05/2024, 8:46 am - American Araiz: Bro this season is so funny
30/05/2024, 8:47 am - ali: i think smash players gonna obviously hate it, smash has had yearssss to finesse their gameplay, having this game exist atleast helps some level of variety in this genre so
30/05/2024, 8:47 am - American Araiz: I’m not seeing that much hate from smash players but yeah because we have had 30 years of polish in our series there’s definitely things smash players are going to be critical of
30/05/2024, 8:48 am - American Araiz: After all smash has dominated the industry of 2D platform fighters for decades
30/05/2024, 8:48 am - American Araiz: And there’s no one even close unlike regular fighters which have Tekken, street fighter and mortal kombat all be successful
30/05/2024, 8:56 am - ali: yea but tekkan is quite different to smash in gameplay wise no?
30/05/2024, 8:58 am - American Araiz: In terms of fighting games there are usually three genres

1.) traditional 2D fighters like street fighter and mortal kombat and dbz fighterz
2.) 2D platform fighters like smash and Multiversus 
3.) 3D arena fighters like Naruto storm. These are least popular and do not have a competitive scene
30/05/2024, 8:58 am - American Araiz: There is one outlier series though and that is Tekken
30/05/2024, 8:58 am - ali: tekkan is more similar to MK tho
30/05/2024, 8:58 am - ali: so wont u put itbin 2d fighter place
30/05/2024, 8:58 am - American Araiz: Tekken is closest to a traditional 2D fighter but it has a z-axis/ third plane of movement
30/05/2024, 8:59 am - American Araiz: Mk and SF are both only x and y axis. You can only move forward back up down
30/05/2024, 8:59 am - ali: i will always love the 3rd one cus the HOURS me and my bro have put in dbz and those naruto games are insane
30/05/2024, 8:59 am - American Araiz: Whereas the stage in Tekken is not 2D. You can rotate around your opponents and stage
30/05/2024, 8:59 am - American Araiz: Tekken is so much more complex than any other fighter that it’s not even close
30/05/2024, 9:00 am - ali: are there platforms to jump onto in tekkan?
30/05/2024, 9:00 am - ali: haaa
30/05/2024, 9:00 am - American Araiz: No. Neither in sf or mk
30/05/2024, 9:00 am - American Araiz: Platform fighters have pretty much exclusively been smash for three decades
30/05/2024, 9:00 am - American Araiz: There have been games that have tried to compete but been flops
30/05/2024, 9:00 am - American Araiz: Brawlhalla
Nickelodeon all stars brawl
Now Multiversus just came out
30/05/2024, 9:01 am - ali: brawlhalla man
30/05/2024, 9:01 am - ali: looks fun
30/05/2024, 9:01 am - ali: but doesnt have my goat lebron james
30/05/2024, 9:01 am - American Araiz: I’ve tried all three of these but man once u play smash it’s like u have experienced wagyu and try to consume dollar store steak
30/05/2024, 9:02 am - American Araiz: Smash ultimate has one of the best gameplay systems I’ve ever seen
30/05/2024, 9:02 am - American Araiz: It’s up there with rocket league for me as much as I shit on that game
30/05/2024, 9:02 am - ali: at what cost( using the switch)
30/05/2024, 9:02 am - American Araiz: It terms of just perfectly made gameplay
30/05/2024, 9:03 am - American Araiz: I mean I think switch is a great console but it’s past it’s time now
30/05/2024, 9:03 am - American Araiz: Some of my favorite games of all time are on the switch
30/05/2024, 9:03 am - American Araiz: Smash ultimate and fire emblem three houses are both in my top 5 games of all time
30/05/2024, 9:03 am - ali: yea but imagine if someone only played the switch
30/05/2024, 9:04 am - ali: so many games they coupdnt play cus switch would give out
30/05/2024, 9:04 am - American Araiz: Yeah I agree switch is a secondary console
30/05/2024, 9:04 am - ali: ywsss
30/05/2024, 9:04 am - American Araiz: U need a pc Xbox or PlayStation as ur primary
30/05/2024, 9:04 am - American Araiz: Xbox dying so hard rn bro
30/05/2024, 9:04 am - ali: like pokemon and mario kart look fun asffff
30/05/2024, 9:04 am - American Araiz: Mass layoffs and studio shutdowns
30/05/2024, 9:04 am - American Araiz: As much as I love PlayStation, Nintendo has better exclusives and that’s a fact
30/05/2024, 9:05 am - ali: yes they have the most popular titles
30/05/2024, 9:05 am - American Araiz: That’s why I’m hoping their next console modernizes the gameplay and graphics of their titles
30/05/2024, 9:05 am - ali: mann i need them to comebac
30/05/2024, 9:05 am - ali: a PS dominance gonna break me

30/05/2024, 9:05 am - American Araiz: PlayStation is successful cause of their single player story games and narratives
30/05/2024, 9:05 am - American Araiz: Xbox ain’t got a single one
30/05/2024, 9:06 am - ali: thats what i mean i hope they fix themselves
30/05/2024, 9:06 am - American Araiz: I was Xbox 360 diehard fan but I have accepted that the Xbox is dying
30/05/2024, 9:06 am - American Araiz: It’s practically getting integrated into pc because of game pass
30/05/2024, 9:06 am - ali: xbox one and ps4 wrre still successfull even tho ps4 was wayyy better
30/05/2024, 9:07 am - ali: ps5 series x

30/05/2024, 9:07 am - ali: no competition
30/05/2024, 9:07 am - American Araiz: Series X is the biggest flop ever
30/05/2024, 9:07 am - American Araiz: In terms of sales PlayStation and Nintendo are neck in neck
30/05/2024, 9:08 am - American Araiz: Xbox is leagues behind
30/05/2024, 9:08 am - ali: I was playing my 360 the other day

04/06/2024, 9:32 pm - American Araiz: Do you actually like these new characters like as much as Aki power Makima?
04/06/2024, 9:32 pm - American Araiz: I was like 30-40 chaps into part 2 but I didn’t like any of these new characters by the time I dropped it
04/06/2024, 9:34 pm - ali: asa is really the only new characwr and i realllyyy like her and might even more than aki, rest are just recurring and some new ones no cus theyre just not in there enough
04/06/2024, 9:34 pm - ali: i still like what fujimoto is doing with asa and denji amd their dynamic is perfect for the story
04/06/2024, 9:35 pm - ali: but pacinf is slow
04/06/2024, 9:35 pm - American Araiz: Does the story feel like it’s progressing anywhere?
04/06/2024, 9:35 pm - ali: story is now moreso denjis growth and yes it has
04/06/2024, 9:35 pm - ali: and also i feel like this last part
04/06/2024, 9:35 pm - ali: no way he does a part 3 or something
04/06/2024, 9:35 pm - American Araiz: Hmm
04/06/2024, 9:36 pm - American Araiz: Guess we’ll see
04/06/2024, 9:36 pm - American Araiz: But I’m pretty sure I’ll stay anime only for csm
04/06/2024, 9:36 pm - ali: yea absolutely
04/06/2024, 9:36 pm - ali: csm fans online giving up on fujimoto lmaoo
04/06/2024, 9:37 pm - American Araiz: I understand why lol
04/06/2024, 9:38 pm - American Araiz: Idk I feel like both csm and jjk and extremely strong starts and authors knew exactly what they wanted to do but as it got more successful and kept going on they didn’t know where to take their story
04/06/2024, 9:38 pm - ali: <Media omitted>
04/06/2024, 9:38 pm - American Araiz: Csm a bit more thank jjk
04/06/2024, 9:38 pm - American Araiz: Jjk still has some really high highs
04/06/2024, 9:39 pm - ali: jjk still theres a direction and alot of good points,  i feel for fujimoto cus he clearly wanted a slower paced part 2 and story which i also like but idk maybe when anime comes on I'll like it even more rn im just confused, i still dont hate it
04/06/2024, 9:40 pm - American Araiz: Yeah I think anime will almost always do more justice to material
04/06/2024, 9:40 pm - American Araiz: But still yeah csm feels like a completely different story now than part 1
04/06/2024, 9:47 pm - American Araiz: Ok so I read the chapter out of curiosity
04/06/2024, 9:47 pm - American Araiz: Aside from the fact that this whole chapter could’ve been done in 3 pages
04/06/2024, 9:47 pm - ali: hahahaha
04/06/2024, 9:47 pm - American Araiz: Why is the art so bad now????

04/06/2024, 9:47 pm - ali: yea i hope fujimoto doin okay
04/06/2024, 9:48 pm - ali: its been rough lately
04/06/2024, 9:48 pm - American Araiz: These look like incomplete sketches
04/06/2024, 9:49 pm - ali: asa casually sexually assaulted by yoru bruh i dont even wanna read next week to see her reaction
04/06/2024, 9:49 pm - American Araiz: Man I need this weeks one piece chapter to recover from this
04/06/2024, 9:50 pm - American Araiz: Let’s see if this weeks jjk chapter will make community love or hate gege again
04/06/2024, 9:50 pm - ali: that mf will always have thr craziest parity
04/06/2024, 9:50 pm - ali: never seen such divison
04/06/2024, 9:51 pm - American Araiz: I been reading too much manga weekly lately I need to go back to anime

04/06/2024, 9:52 pm - American Araiz: I used to think a 20 min anime episode is too short to consume weekly

04/06/2024, 9:53 pm - ali: fairssss
04/06/2024, 9:53 pm - American Araiz: Jjk memes are way more entertaining than discussions and theories
04/06/2024, 9:57 pm - American Araiz: It’s a fact bro

04/06/2024, 10:02 pm - American Araiz: Jjk scratches a different itch for me
04/06/2024, 10:02 pm - ali: u dont need to compare everything to one piece king
04/06/2024, 10:03 pm - American Araiz: I don’t do it by choice brother. I have been spoiled beyond measure by that series
04/06/2024, 10:03 pm - American Araiz: When u talk about themes and storytelling and worldbuilding my brain automatically associates those words to one piece because that’s what it excels at😭
04/06/2024, 10:14 pm - American Araiz: Man how are ur two weekly manga csm and jjk😭
04/06/2024, 10:14 pm - American Araiz: Battle to see which author gets hated more on the timeline each week

04/06/2024, 10:16 pm - American Araiz: Every series being set same place makes it kinda boring for me

06/06/2024, 11:32 pm - American Araiz: Short chapter aside why is Sukuna still winning man tf
06/06/2024, 11:32 pm - American Araiz: How much stamina this mf got
06/06/2024, 11:32 pm - ali: when they said he has the perfect body for jujutsu they were not lying
06/06/2024, 11:33 pm - ali: plus 1000 years of experience
06/06/2024, 11:33 pm - American Araiz: Bro has fought everyone how is he still kicking
06/06/2024, 11:33 pm - American Araiz: And that too against a Frankenstein of the two other strongest
06/06/2024, 11:34 pm - ali: one of the smartest thing sukuna did was using a binding vow so he has to use only one hand to call his domain since he lost 2 on one side
06/06/2024, 11:34 pm - ali: yuta gonna prove getos question right, that its moreso gojo being strong not his abilities
06/06/2024, 11:34 pm - American Araiz: I still barely understand binding vows is there any consequence to them??
06/06/2024, 11:35 pm - ali: yea his domain was severly reduced in range and damage, thas why almost everyone survived when todo came
06/06/2024, 11:35 pm - American Araiz: Oh acha
06/06/2024, 11:35 pm - American Araiz: Man I forgot todo was still here
06/06/2024, 11:35 pm - ali: final panel is interesting of rika holding yuta and narrator saying 'but...'
06/06/2024, 11:35 pm - American Araiz: Yeah that was definitely cool
06/06/2024, 11:36 pm - American Araiz: I think rika might awaken or go on a rampage or smth
06/06/2024, 11:36 pm - ali: obvi yuta gojo gonna lose but interesting to see
06/06/2024, 11:36 pm - ali: also jjk editor said last chapter was climax
06/06/2024, 11:36 pm - American Araiz: Ofc they are man sukuna can’t take an L
06/06/2024, 11:36 pm - ali: if theyre right which they werent last time they said it, there has to be an arc after this
